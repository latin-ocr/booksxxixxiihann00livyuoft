NOTES. XXI. c. 11. §g 4-6. 153

5 4. plus quam modlcae. Fabius Pictor (ap. Polyb. 111.
8) stated that Hasdrubal returned to Carthago from Spain,
with the design of making himself despot‚ but being opposed
by the ἀξιόλογοι ἄνδρες, he returned to Spain, disregarding
henceforth the authority of the senate, as did his successor
Hannibal. This Polyb. regards as an idle essm-t of faction to
throw all the odium of the war on the Barcine faetion, which
later history reflecting such jealousies of party calls an ἑταιρία
τῶν πονηροτάτων ἀνθρώπων.

plebem...pr1ncipum. Sec the Introduction for a sketch of
the government oi Carthago. Livy here, as elsewhere, employs
ἷῧξὴέἐὲξέ Roman terms, as ii the constitutional usages were

haud sane. Cf. 1111. 19. 12. Livy does not seem to use
uon sane. Fabri.

ς 5. hospitus. Formal eontraets of friendly alliance were
often entered iuto in the old world between persons, families
and tribes, pledges of which were interchanged as ξύμβολα or
tesserae. Doeuments are still preserved in the inscriptions in
which engagements of this kind are entered into or formally
renewed, as in one where two Spanish olaus (yentilitates) of th'e
same tribe hospicium vetustum antiquom renovaverunt eique
omnes alis alium in fidem clientelamque suam suorumque libero-
rum posterorumque recepit. One form lasted on in Greeee in the
προξενίσ. which was largely used in eommercial and religione
intercourse. Corssen 1. 796 explains hospes as a shortened
form of hosti-pe(t)s= stranger-protecting from root pazis =
πόσις. As to the root syhas- from which he derives hostis,
Mommsen, R. F. 326, regards it as simply=‘to eat.' Corssen
says it is to ‘tear’ or ‘wound.'

concinandis. Hasd. according to Diodorus, 25. 17, married
himself the daughter of one of the Sp. chieftains; principes
may be distinguished from reguli as nobles from kings, as
Weissenborn suggests.

56. nihilo tutior. For the form of the phrase Fabri
compares nihilo accuratior v. 37. 1, nihilo quietior, 11. 37. 1,
nihilo facilior, mr. 26. 5.

ridentis speciem. Here as often Livy employs a partic.
absolutely, where we should use a subst. Compare the Stoic
ἓῗέἒίἑεὲἑοὲἒὲιηὲἓ uncivilized races with the sensibilities oi the'

praebuerit. The frequency of the subjunc. perf. in depen-
dent sentences after ut is a peculiarity of Livy's style, as reah-
zing more vividly the completed result
