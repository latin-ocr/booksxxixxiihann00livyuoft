signal was not in such cases given, as usually, by the sound of
a trunipct.

thc Ticinus, but that is implied in the withdrawal to tho

§3 Prius...quam...sciret H. Polyb. explains the delay

sexcentos mor. Polyb. makes H. march up to the bridge
on the Ticinus (ἕως τοῦ πρώτου ποταμοῦ) and capture the 600
who were left behind to break the bridge by taking up the
planks (σανίδες) which stretched from pier to pier. H. then

Po ‘to find a suitahlc spot for crossing. Livy clearly implies
that H. crossed the Ticinus, and found the 600 engaged in

either army crossing the. Trebia on its way to Placentia, and
‘the langunge of both Livy and Polybius is general enough for
any position in the neighbourhood. Niebuhr and others have
assumed that Scipio retrestted to the east of Trebia, and that
Hannibal following him thither cut him off from his com-

numiontions with Rome. This view seems quite untenable for
the following reasons:

taking up his position on hilly ground near it. If this new
