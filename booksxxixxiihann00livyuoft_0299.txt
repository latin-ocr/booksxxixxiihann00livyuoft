ἕ 9. equestris ord. al. 111 early days at Rome the equites
had been drawn exclusively from the noblcr and wealthier
classes, but after a time nn increasing number of volunteers
were allowed to serve on horscback, while the equites equo
publico were relieved of the obligation of service. The latter
were often sons of senators, or men of high position, but the
cavalry did not long rank high in the army, and was drawn
largely from the unies. Strictly the phrase equest. ortlo is an
anachronism, as no such distinction was made before the

Gracchi.

The term ‘proefecti’ was especially used ior the officers of
-the allied contingente, as well as of the navy, cf. 61. 4. In
the Roman army it was little used till the time of the Empire.

by Livy. and is ignored by Polybius. It was probably to guard
the coast road to Rome, and passes of the mountains by which
Hannibal might open his communicatione with the fieets of
Carthage. see note on 58. 3. But it was hazardous to leave
the road by Ariminum unguarded.

which, with the exception of Massilia, fell before the Phoe-

round the Syrtis Minor.
