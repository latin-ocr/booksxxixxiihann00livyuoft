280 NOTES. XXII. c. xxxw. ἓξ 1-8.

the patres, or patricii, are always spoken of in this connexion,
and it is probable, as Mommsen says (Rem. Forschungen,
p. 219), that only the patrician senators took part in the forma-
lities of the interreqnum.

certamine patrum ac pl. The old constitutional struggle
between the patricians and plebs had been finally decided when
all the higher offices of state were thrown open to the latter
body. But during the last century a nobility had been gradu-
ally formed, consisting of the families whether of patrician or
plebeian origin which had gained possession of the curule offices,
and therefore of the ius imaginum. This nobility was repre-
sented by the senate which consisted of ex-officials, and the
privileges which it held de facto were clung to more tenaciously
than the de iure claim of the older patriciate.

§7. foedus, ‘compact.'

hom. novum, used distinctively henceforward of thefew who
rose to a level with the privileged circle of nobility by gaining
the consulship, but contemptuously applied like parvenu. The
absence of such a term in English marks the distinctive feature
of an aristocracy which has been always recruited freely from
lower social strata.

§8. eisdem...sacriS. This probably is a metaphor taken
from the pledges of a secret society, as is the aristocratic clubs
had bound themselves like those in old days in Greece by the
oath τῷ δήμῳ κακόνους ἔσομαι.

It might with less likelihood be taken in the sense that the
prominent plebeian families had identified themselves with the
patrician by intermarriage and prejudices, whereas stress had
been laid by the opponents of such intercourse (legalized by
the Canuleian law) on the religious divisions of the two orders,
which had distinct family sacra.
