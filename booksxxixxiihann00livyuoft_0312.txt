lently chosen to watch the movements of Hannibal whose easiest
road to Rome lay through Umbria by the Via Flaminia, which
had been made a few years before by C. Flaminius. If com-
municatione were kept up between the two consuls at Arretium
and Ariminum they might hope to combine the forces when the
route of the invaders was discovered. Precisely the same ar-
rangements had been made to cover Rome in the Gallie war of
225 nc. But like the GauJS‚ H. took a Western pass, and
marched by the Roman forces at Arretium, which then fol-
lowed in pursuit, and were routed before the other army could

arrive upon the scene.

§ 3. inter. Fabri remarks that it is in Tacitus that we
find most examples of this position of inter between its two
cases,

§4 non modo legum... Livy reproduces here without
misgiving the patrician prejudices of his authorities, and
Polyb„ alien as he waS, does the same, enlarging upon the
duty of the general to ascertain the bias of his rival, as H. did
in this case.

ξ 6. laeva is here inexplicable. If H. moved towards
Faesulae, he must have had the R. at Arretium on his n‘ght.
Hence it would be better to read a Faesulis petens medios Etr.
aoros (W.). But it is quite possible that it was a blunder of
Livy himself, and not of his editors. Hannibal was moving
southwards, and swept round the Trasimene lake to entrap
Flaminius, who was marching after him.

ἕ 7. Flaminius, qul... It is hazardous to impute misstate-
ments to ancient writers in cases where we have no other
evidence at hand, but it seems most probable that this part of
the history is disfigured by the aristocratia prejudices of the
Annalists who threw the blame of the disaster ot Lake
Trasimene on the rashness of Flaminius. Yet he must have
heard some days before of the march of Hannibal, and sent
