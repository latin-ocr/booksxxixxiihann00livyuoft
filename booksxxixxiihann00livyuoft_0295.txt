settled after their migration {rom Gaul (Livy v. 34). Brixia
(Brescia) was their capital.

55. diducta is a correction of Drakenb. for deducta ; for
the leves armaturae sunt of the MSS. Madvig replaces levis

ammenta, as the plural is quite unneccssary.

P, 61, g 8. quas recentes.. We require in English a less
involved constr. ‘ior the Carth. had come in the ireshness of
their strength!

Remanent... ⁸ Their com-age would have held out.’

ς) 10. Tamen. For the position and context of t. Fabri
compares 1. 24. 1, tamen in re tam clara nominum error manet.

ξ 11. velites. Livy uses this term proleptically, for xxvr.
4. 5 he describes the formation of a class of light troops so
called, to be carried behind the horsemen, and to dismount
when it came to close quarters. They were incorporated with
the legions (institutum ut zelites in leyionibus essent) as they
were better armed with parma and qladius than the rorarii
ferentarii accensi velati of early times, who now disappear
from sight. The velites themselves were abolished by Marius.
For their use against ei ephants, cf. Vegetius 111. 24, praecipue
-velites antiqui adversum elephantos ordinarunt.

ad id ipsum. The MSS. omit the id, as they do cosin v.
43. 4, per ipsos dies, contrary to the ordinary usage. On the
iggeclnpffiupplying the demonstrative, cf. Madvig on Cic. de

verutis. Livy had mentioned this dart as one of the
weapons of the 4th class of the Servian centurieS, 1. 43. 6.

c. ιη. ξ 1. adversus G. The Gauls had less experience
ffisslleghsszts than the Romans, who had learnt their habits in

Hanmbal. The position of the subject at the end of the
sentence is characteristic οὶ the differ-enee between the order
ἓξῖιιιὲἓῑιιῐ and modern language3‚ which is here pushed to an .

ἓ 2.1.n orbem pugn. The form imp lies two ideas, the
being forced in orbem, and the fighting in pthat order. Sallust
Jug. 97 thus explains it, Romani veteres et ob id scientes belli,
εἰ quos locus aut casus conjunxerat, orbes facere, atque ita ab
omnibus partibus simul tecti ct instructi simul vim sustentabant.
It thus resembles our ‘forming square) Cf. 11. 50. 5, orbem
colliyere‚1v. 28. 3, orbem volventes suos, CaesarB. G. v. 33. 3, in
orbem emt-sisterent’.
