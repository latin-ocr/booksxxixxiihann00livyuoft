power of Egypt, bringing together the scattercd 616-
ments of tin and coppcr to be combined by the in-
dustrial arts of the early age of bronzc. The course
of these Phoenician adventurers was directed almost
wholly by the interests of trade, but on the Northern
coast of Africa their colonies assumed another cha—
racter. There were indeed some early settlements
from Sidon 011 1116 shore, as at Hippo and at Gambe,
1but these were probably of little note, till larger
streams of immigrants appeared, who, unlike the rest,
betook themselves to the interior, and lived an agri-
cultural life. There is reason to believe that they
were Canaanites from the inland, dispossessed perhaps
by Israel under J oshua from the country 011 1116 North
of Palestine, and guided from the ports of Sidon to
their new homes by pilots already familiar with 1116
country. Here they may have found some kindred
races, peoples of the Hittite stock, who had spread
from Egypt in the period known as that of the in-
vasion of the Shepherd dynasties. The new comers
mingled with the native Libyans, and from their
union in the course of ages grew the numerous popu-
lations found in later times in Zeugitana and Byza-
cene‚ and known as a mixed race by the name of
ξ Liby-phoenicians.

When Sidon fell before a sudden onset of the
Philistines in Rc. 1209, Tyre stepped into her place, as
the chief power of the Phoenician league, which took
up henceforth a more decided policy in the sar West.
