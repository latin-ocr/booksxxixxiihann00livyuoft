ἓ 10. eam nubem. The figure is probably copied from
Homer [l. 5. 522, νεφέλῃσιν ἐοικότες, dare Κρονίων Ι νηνεμίης
ἔστησεν ἐπ’ ἀκροπόλοισιν ὄρεσσι, Ι ἀτρέμας ὄφρ’ εὕδῃσι μένος βορέαο
καὶ ἄλλων Ι ζαχρειῶν ἀνέμων, οἵτε νέφεα σκιόεντα. Ι πνοιῃσιν λιγυ-
ρῇσι διασκιδνᾶσιν devm.

ο. xxm. ἓ 1. centum viginti, supplied by Lipsius irom
Pol. 1v. 96, as Livy would not have added ‘navium without a
definite number. As to Servilius cf. 11. 7.

52. Menige. Cf. Polyb. 1. 39, παρεγίγνοντο πρὸς τὴν τῶν
Λωτοφάγων νῆσον ἦ καλεῖται μὲν Μῆνιγξ, οὐ μακρὰν δ’ ἀπέχει
τῆς μικροῖς Σύρτεως. It is now called J erbah.

Cercinam, now Karkeneh at the N. W. extremity of the
Syrtis opposite to Menige.

ἓ 3. iuxta...ac si = ‘just as if,’ an unusual construction
though found in Cic. Or. post red. 8. 20, iuxta ac si meus frater
esset, and Sall. Jug. 45. 2 Fabri.

semestri. The dictatorship was never held more than 6
months (Liv. 111. 29. 5), probably because it was at first used
only ior military naeus, and the early campaigns lasted only
through the summer. Mommsen also makes it probable that
it lasted only to the end of the term of the ordinary magistrate
who named to it. This may explain the later mistake that

Camillus was dictator for a whole year, caused by Livy's words

58. Omnium prope ann. So also do the Fasti, the Elogium
of Fabius Max„ and Polyb. 111. 87, as other authorities. It is
