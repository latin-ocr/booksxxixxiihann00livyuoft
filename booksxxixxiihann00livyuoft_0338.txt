P. 104, ξ 5. specie classis.. Cf. 11. 7.

gij. duos praetores. Cf. 31. 6 for Τ. Otacilius, and xxm.
21. 4 ior A. Cornelius Mammula.

ἓ 7. campanum... Cf. 15. 4.

’ἓ 9. ut...ut. ‘As soon as’...‘as if.’ The repetition in a
different sense is akaward.

ξ 10. abrogando. A Roman magistrate could not be
constitutionally deposed except by a legislative act, or vote of
the comitia. Early tradition cited such a case at the begin-
ning of the republie‚ Brutus...colleyce suo imperium abroqavit
Cic. Brut. 14. 53, but in the best days of Rome there was
scarcely any example known. for G. Flaminius would probably
not have been deposed, as Livy xxr. 63. 2 impHes, but declared
illegally elected, vitio creatus. Cinna was deposed, but only
by a vote of the senate according to Appian, and he regarded
the act as null and void. But though there was no regular
precedent of a consul, we hear of abrogation in the case of
pro-consuls (Liv. Epit. 67) and tribunes as in the famous case
of M. Octavius, 132 n-c.

g 12. 111 actione...popu1a1‡ ‘ In a course of action which
would have found little favour with the peop1e‚’ i.e. in opposing
the bill of the tribune. The MSS. commonly read popularis
agreeing with dictator, in the sense ⁴ as he would have con-
ciliated them little by his bearing towards them.’ Actio is
often used by Livy of the resolution proposed to the assembly,
or the speech in support of it. Cf. 11. 56. 3, huic actioni yra-
tissimae plebi quum summa vi resisterent patres, and 111. 1. 3,
tribuniciis se iactare actionibus. Here it is used more gene-
rally for ‘ political action)

513. acceptas referret. ‘Set them down to the account
of: literally ‘to the credit side.’ So v. 22. 2, nec duci...nec
senatui, sed Liciniae fainilioe...acceptum referebant.

dictum ⁴ order‚' as 11. 18. 6, ad dieto parendum.

5 17. concilium is technically distinguished from the
comitia, the general assemblies of the whole people eonvened
for legislative or elective purposes. It is therefore applied to

the meetings of foreign peoples, or of Roman corporatione,
and especially to the assemblies of the plebs, considered as a
