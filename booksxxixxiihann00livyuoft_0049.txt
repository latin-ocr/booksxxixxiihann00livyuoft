INTRODUOTION. II. xxxix

literary treatment, for which the first chroniclers
cared little, but which seemed of paramount impor-
tance as the taste for rhetorio increased. Thus
Cicero speaks contemptuously of the meagre and
graceless annals, rough hewn, as he imphes, by pren-
tice hands which had as yet no experience or skill
of literary craft (De Orac. 11. 12).

The earlier chroniclers, he adds, seem to have
chiefly aimed at brevity, and to have told their story
simply, without a thought of grace or diction (non
exornatores sed narratores). Of those included in this
sweeping criticism the first recorded were contem-

Cincius Alimentus both bore a part in the great
struggle, and are referred to as authorities by Livy, .
as 111011 who helped to make history as well as write
it. Of those who followed some like M. Porcius Cato
and L. Calpurnius Piso took a high rank in the
world of polines, but are included in Cicero’s sweeping
censure as historians without a style. The first who
aimed at dignity of language was Oaelius Antipater,
who lived in the period of the Gracchi, a century later
than the first chroniclers just mentioned. There was
little elegance indeed, adds Cicero (de leq. 1. 2), in
the rough vigour of his style, but at least we may see
in him the first beginning of something like literar-y ’
