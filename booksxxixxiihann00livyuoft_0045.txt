it for a time, with little effort to balance or correct
from other sources, till at length another was taken
in its place, to be used for a while with equal free-
dom. But in the third decade of Livy the elements
of the mosaic are much smaller than in the fourth

with Polybius is most marked, and yet in them the
variations are often too minute and numerous to be
consistent with such a method of procedure as that
which has been stated. If Livy had had the pages
of Polybius before him, he would probably have fol-
