NOTES. XXI. c. xxxvr. §v-c. xxxvn. 54. 203

ς ’1. [ut a] lub. The MSS. read ut a lubrica, where the
proposition would seem out οἱ place. Sauppe and W. change
this to via. ‘ On the slippcry track where the ice gave no foot-
hold, but let the feet elide over it all the easier‚ as it was a
eteep incline.’ Madv. needlessly quarrels with via on the
ground that there was no road, cf. ἓ 5, but it seems better to
omitit ae an awkward addition.

of cubiculum, sediculum. Corssen 11. 416.

ln levi tantum. ‘Rolled in what was only smooth ice or
slush of snow.’ ‘ Only) because no viryulta, διο.

fusum, quoe non ruperit iqnis antecedens, cf. Juv. x. 153, Didu-

by winding tracks of gradual deseent! Cf. Verg. Georg. 111.
293, clivus mollis. Caes. B. G. v11. 46, quidquid circuitus ad

from ambi and sray (franyo). To the objection
to this derivation made by Zeyss, that anfractus means a
‘bend’ rather than a ‘break,’ Corssen, 1. 397, quotes Cic. Nat.

incisum angulis, nihil anfractibus, nihil eminens, nihil lacuno-
sum.

ς 4. prope tame abs. They might have been quite starved

ing a broader path for the elephante.

quantum detracturus est. cf. Lucr. 11. 16, hoc (ευτ’ quodcum-
que.
