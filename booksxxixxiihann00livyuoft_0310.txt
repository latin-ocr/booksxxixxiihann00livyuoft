ξ 11. Mavors. The Italian Mars was the god οῖ Spring‚
which began in the mouth of March, and with it the hopes of
husbandry. His name connected with marmor, mare, Maro,
Marias, is thought to mean ‘bright‚‘ and the 12 Salii with
their orb-shaped ancilia to represent the months and moons.
Only seeondarily was this Mars connected with War, as in
spring time the men mustered in the Campus Martius and
sallicd out on their campaigns, but under Hellenic influence
the attributes οἱ Ἀρης were transferred to Mars. Μ avora seems
to be a distinet name, more warlike in its sense, and Corsseu
connects the first syllable with μάχη μάχαιρα maymentum, and
the second with vortere, Vertumnus, Sco„ 1. 410.

§ia aeclem Saturni. This was at the foot of the Clivus
Capitolinus, and the hill above went in old days by the name

ex hibernis. In Liguria, xxr. 59. 10. The movements of the

Roman troops since the battle of the Trebia are not clear. Some -

legions had wintered at Placentia, others with Sempronius
at Luca, though we are not told why H. allowed them to
divide their forces unmolested. The former division was
ordered by Flaminius to meet at Ariminum, and he is also said
to have taken the command at the same place, inde, xxx. 63.
15, of the force of Sempronius which had wintered at Luca, and

with both to have marched into Etruria to cover Arretium. But ῃ

when the campaign opens Cn. Servilius is posted near Arimi-
num, ΠΗ. 9, and is not in time to join his colleague before
the battle of Trasimene.
