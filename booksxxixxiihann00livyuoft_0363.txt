NOTES. XXII. c. ι.. §G—c. m. §4- 295

⁷ δοιώ an Lamnus. Gt. the different treatment described in

munus socius. Livy more commonly distinguishes the
socii or Italians generally {rom the Latius, as socias Lati-
numque nomen, 57. 10, or uses socii alone if no precise state-
ment is needed. W. suggests that the two terms may be used
by asyndeton like patres conscripti, but it is very unlikely, as
there is no frequent usage to account for it.

ς 7. dves. Less usual for ¹ fellow-eitizens‚' as xxr. 13. 1,
³2⁶.va vester Alco. Mark the rapid change from mavultis to

tu and estis.

ἕ 9. quamvts qualifies consertos.

ς 10. Haec ubi... An hexameter and a half have here
slipped into the prose text. The vigorous rhetoric ot* the
gas-{sago partly accounts for the oversight. Cf. note on xxr.

P, 133, ξ 11. translatis ln d.. This seems to be borrowed

Ι from Caelius according to a fragment preserved in Priscian,

lillll3 22liag⁷oeli1⁹ts in primo historiarum ‘ dextimos in dextris scuta
j et ere.

ad sexcentos. Yet often we have the nom. with ad in the
sense offere as above, 41. 2 and 54. 1.

c. m. ξ 1. bello. ‘As if the war itself, not the battle
alone, were ended.’ (W.) This is probably too farfetched, as
bellum is used elsewhere in L. for puyna, cf. xxr. 8. 2.

ξ 2. According to Aul. Gen. x. 24 and Macrobius 1. 4, the
same story occurred both in Cato and Caelius in nearly the
same form. Die quinto Romae in C'apitolfflm curabo tibi cena
sit cocta. It was probably taken by Livy directly from Caelius.

ἓ 3. nimis laeta. Cf. 40. 1.

quam ut eam... Possibly to avoid the awkwardness of
quam quam. Cf. 111. 9. 8, somnio Ioetiore quam quod memes
eorum capessere possent.

temporis opus esse. For this constr. cf. xxm. 21. 5, quanti
argenti opus fuit. The commoner constructions are with abl.
as duce opus est, maturato opus est, or nom. as non dua: opus
est, or inf. as quid opus est dicere.

9 4. Non omma, ecc. For the sentiment cf. Eurip. Rhesus
105, ἀλλ’ οὒ ’γὰρ αὐτὸς πάντ’ ἐπίστασθαι βροτῶν πέφυκεν ..... Ι σοὶ
μὲν μάχεσθαι, τοῖς δέ βουλεύειν καλῶς.
