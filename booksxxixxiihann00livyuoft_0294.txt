P 60 ξ 8. quicquid. ‘ The nearer they came to the cur-
rente· of {air about the river, the more piercing was the frosty
breezess Cf. vn. 32. 4, quicquid ab urbe lonyius proferrent

g 9, pectoribus tenus aucta. ⁶ Swollen so as to be breast
high: Proleptically.

utique egressis. ⁴ The more so as they stepped out of the
water!

c. ΙΝ. ἓ, 2. octo f. millia. This number is too large for the
B. only, and Madvig therefore inserts ac before levem. Polyb.
111. 72 says τοὺς λογχοφόρους καὶ Βαλεαρεΐς.

virium...roboris. Cf. the same combination xxr. 1. 2.
Robur emphasizes the power of endurance. Cf. Tac. Hist. 11.
4. 6, quantum illis roboris discrimina et labor, tantum his
vigoris addiderat ‘intem-a quies.

ἓ 3. receptui. The dative is one of a class of verbal sub-
stantives and gerundival expressions, which may be explained
as the dative of the contemplated end, as decemviri leqibus
scribendis, oleas usu-i optime condi, dcc. The siynztm receptui
becomes a compound subject in the nomin., as 111. 22. 10, si
receptui cecinisset. Cf. Roby Lat. Gr. 11. xxxn.

§4. Duodeviginti, i. e. five legions, after deducting losses
in Gaul and garrisons in Sicily. But Polyb. reckons only
16‚000‚ and specifies that as the strength of the four legions
which both consuls combined on great occasions. He re.-
peatedly says that the socie⁴ furnished about as many infantry,
and three times as many cavalry as the Romans. The muster-
rolls contained 325,000 P.. with 443‚000 socii in Italy fit for ser-
vice at this time. The amma were now Italian; Cisalpine
Gaul was not yet considered as Italy.

Latium only, who stood in definite relation to the Roman
state. Gradually however some of these were drawn closer to
the mistress city, and their inhabitants admitted to the full
franchise, while their place was taken by fresh eolonies that
were sent out, and by communities of central Italy, which were
raised to the same status. In course of time therefore the

Latin colonies, and most of the tribes in the centre-

cenomanorum. These, with the Veneti, had been the only
Gauls faithful to Rome in the recent Gallie war, and even their
fidelity had been mistrusted, cf. Polyb. 11. 23. They held the
country between the Adda and the Adige, where they had
