EXCURSUS ΟΝ ΤΗΕ ROMAN RELIGION
IN RELATION TO THE PRODIGIES
IN LIVY XXI. 62 AND XXII. 10¹.

WE must turn to the Antiquarians of Rome, rather than to
the historians or the poets, if we would learn the charae-
teristic features of the old Italian Worship‚ for in later days
they were so over-laid by the exotio growth of Greek religion
that it was not easy to recognize their earlier forms.

The Latin husbandman was deeply impressed by the sense
of his dependence on the powers of earth and sky: at every
turn his path was crossed by some supernatural being on
whose influence, whether kindly or malign, his weal or woe was
subject. He analysed by cool reflection all the processes of
daily life from the cradle to the grave, and for every incident
within the family or social circle, for every detail of husbandry
he found some guardian Power which he worshipped as di-
vine. The names, harsh and uncouth as they may seem to ns,
carried their meaning on their face, and expressed the limits
of the powers assigned3 they were at first probably but
Attributes of the One Great Unknown; the Jupiter or Divus
pater, who moved in mysterious ways through Nature. The
deities of Italy were never dressed up in human shapes by
fancy, and artless hymns were the only forms of poetry which
grew out of their worship. But the ritual needed for it was
laborious and complex; all the details as gathered in the
course of ages by tradition had to be punctiliously observed,
else prayers and offerings were deemed null and void. In
the family the house-father taught his children3 in larger
groups the brotherhoods (sodalicia) passed on from hand to
hand the saving knowledge, while for the State priestly gujlds
(colleyin), which never could die out, kept in their custody
the sacred lore, which like the fire upon the city’s hearth,
burnt always with a steady flame. Of these, the College of
the Pontiffs was even in the earliest age of Rome the supreme
guardian of the State Religion. It scarcely dealt with the
spiritual life of the family and 311131101- social groups3 it left
to others the purely ministerial functione of the priest; its duty
was to guard, to harmonize, and to interpret the Publio Code
