seems a better retort, though less near the MSS. Krauss
suggests at liberum est Saguntum, referring to the treaty with
Hasdrubal, 2. 7, which provided Say. mediis inter imperia
duorum populorum libertas servaretur. This was followed,
however, by a compact between Rome and Saguntum, Pol. 111.

meddling with the autonomy of S„ and when just above he
says neque eos quos statuit terminos observat. (Rhein. Mus.

ἓ 7. meas. As if Carthage were speaking by prosopopaeia.

Etiam (in) Hisp. There is much doubt as to the reading of
the whole sentence. Madv. inserts the in, and separates the
