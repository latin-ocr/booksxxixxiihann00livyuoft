NOTES. XXI. c. Lx111. §g 3-7. 237

adverso sen. ‘In the teeth of the senate;' though tho
sanction of the sonate was not constitutionally necessary, it
was scarcely ever iguored.

ἓ 4. ad tructus, i.e. sor the stowage of the produce of
their own estates as dIstinct from speculative ventures in
foreign trade. Cf. Cic. Rosc. Am. ἓ 88, qzeoestum nosset nullum,
fructum autem eum solum, quem labore peperisset.

indecorus visus. Patribus to be taken with ind. not visus.
This law may have been popular (v. savorem apud plebem)
with the people generally, from the barbarous prejudice
against trade which had been so largely shared by the old
taces of the West, and which made it seem discreditable to the
governing classes. The immediate causo may have been to
prevent the ruling families from abusing their power in the
provinces to enrich themselves and their friends by com-
mercial speculations, supported by all the powers of the
government. The prohibition therefore extended to the sons
of the senators, or to the class as a whole. But it was also ,
popular with the middle class, which thus escaped the com-
petition of the wealthiest families in speculation. The law
was at once acause, and an effect of the growing power of a
moneyed arsstocracy, which was afterwards known as the
,ordo equester. Cicero afterwards speaks oi this regulation as
obsolete‚ Verr. v. 18. 45, antiquoe sunt ἰᾶται teyes et mortua} quoe
vetant (rectificare navem senatorem).

ς 5. auspiciis ement. Cf. X. 40. 4, Pullarius auspicium men-
tiri ausus. The whole system of auspicia had been so grossly
ubused for politica] objects, that statesmen ceased to regard it
as anything but an engine oi statecraft.

Latin. feriarum. This ancient festival dated from the days
when Rome was a member of the Latin league, and the highest
magistrates of the various towns (ἅπασα ἡ συναρχία, Strabo) went
in solemn procession to the temple of Jupiter Latiarzs on the
Alban mount. This was kept up for ages, and more days
were added to commemorate the reconciliation oi Plebs and
Patres. The consuls were expected to offer the sacrifices, and
one of their first duties was concipere ser. Lat., or to fix a time
for the great festival.

consularibus impedim. ‘Hindrances thrown in the con-
sul‘s way‚’ like dictatoria invidia, xxu. 26. 4.

§ 7. inauspicato. It was held to be the duty of the general
on the day of his leaving Rome for the wars to go up to the
Capitol to take the auspices at daybreak. After the votorum
nuncupatio he put on the short purple paludamentum (other-
wise sayum or chlamys), and was escorted by his friends be·
yond the gates. Ad bellum cum exit imperator ac lictores
