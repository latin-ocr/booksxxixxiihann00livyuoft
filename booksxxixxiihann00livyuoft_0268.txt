202 NOTES. XXI. c. XXXVI. ἐξ 1— 6.

ut aeg-re... 'l'his would be absurdly exaggerated if it referred
to the ordinary state of the pass, If however we understand
it as caused by a recent landslip or avalanche, it would be
consistent with experience. There is one spot especially on
the Little St Bernard exposed to such casualties, and to this
the description of Polybius well applies. He speaks however
of the road being carried away, σχεδὸν ἐπὶ τρία ὴμιστάδια, but
Livy mistaking this, or the language of their common au-
thority, converts it into a. precipice of a 1000 feet in depth (if
we accept, that 13, Valla's almost certain corrections of the
meaningless readings of the MSS). ‘This‚‘ says Niebuhr, ‘is
nonsense, as all must see.’

expeditus. Cf. vn. 34. 3, collem aditu arduum impedito
damini, expeditis haud difficilem. So expediti equites ‘light
troops.’ Expedita classis, aymen, venatores, dcc. in Livy.

Ρ, 39, ξ 2. admodum = maxime,fere‚ μάλιστα.

ξ 3. miranti = cum admiratione ‹lucerenti by pregnant use.
Cf. 1. 41. l, mirantium quid rei esset, 111. 35. 5. Niigelsbach,
p. 279, illustrates this by such cases as dodrantem complere:
complementi causa adiicere, triarii postremos claudebant for
claudentes postremi ibant.

ξ 4. circa. On use of the adverb cf. note on 7. 5.

circumduceretzmust take round. On this use of the subj-
for circumducere deberet, v. Madvig, De Finibus 11. 35, who
quotes various passages from Cicero and Livy, xn. 37. 3, uon
triumphum impedire debuit...sed postero die...nomen deferret.
Cf. also Verg. AEn. rx. 643, at tu dietis Albane maneres. Ovidi,
Tristia 1v. 3. 34, Tristis es: indignor, quod sim tibi causa
doloris ,· non es ‚· at amisso eonjuye digma fores.

ξ 5. super veterem... ‘ Over the snow of the last season,
which had not melted.’ A mass of snow often falls into a
ravine or valley, where it is sheltered from the sun's heat, and
remains through a whole summer, forming sometimes a great
natural bridge, through which a river tunnels for itself a
channel. Probably the early historiens referred to some such
mass which bloeked up the spot where H. tried to force a
passage. Livy's account would be more natural in the case of
a glacier, which was not likely to be met with in their way.

ξ ἐξ. fluentem... ‘ The liquid mud formed by the melting
SDOW.

tabem is the correction of Gronovius for the labem of tho
MSS. It is especially used of any melting substance.
