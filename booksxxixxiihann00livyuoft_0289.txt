NOTES. XXI. c. L. §3—c.1.1. §2- 221

P. 55, sicubi conserta.. ‘Whenever a ship was laid
alongside of an enemy.’

ξ 4. sua is used with reference to R.. which though not a
nominative is the real subject of the thought. ‘The R. were
encouraged by their numbers.’

ἓ 5. tres nobiles. Note the small number of Carthagi-
nians of good family who were serving on board; the size of
the fleet too was quite inadequate to its work, and indicates a
growing neglect of the navy at Carthage.

5 6. perforata. ⁴ Stove in.’

§7- classem ornare is to fit out with tackle, sails, oars,
acc. Cf. 1x. 30. 2, duumviros navales classis ornanda, refici-
e‘nclaeque causa.

instructam. Some epithet must have dropped out here,
and this one supplied by Madvig is as likely as any.

§ 8. praetoriam. Note the use of the adj. as in praetorium
for general’s tent, and praetor. cohors, though the consul was
higher in military rank. But ‘consul' was later 111 Italian

usage, and pointed in its form to the dual office, rather than to
the high rank.

§10- quibusdam volentibus. Livy here seems to copy a
familiar Greek idiom, and to make volentibus a sort of dativus
comm. with sore. ‘ Some would be well pleased with a revo-
lution.' Cf. Sall. Jug. 84. 3, neque plebei militia volenti
putabatur, Tac. Ann. 1. 59, ut quibusque bellum invitis aut
cupientibus erat. Yet the constr. is not found elsewhere in
Livy, and it is possible to take volentibus as an abl. abs„ and
the position of the words agrees best with this view.

c. m. ξ 1. Melitam. Malta, 88 miles from the Sicilian
Pachynus. Strabo speaks only of the Maltese dogs in con-
nection with it. It was an early Phoenician settlement, and
the little island Gaulus close by has some remarkable remains
of Phoenician art. On the question whether it was the same
as the Melita of Acts xxviii. see J. Smith on the Voyage and
Shipwreck of St Paul, p. 160.

P, 56 ξ 2. sub corona venierunt. ‘ Were sold by auctiona’
Aul. Gell. vn. 4 explains the phrase as derived from the
garland put on the head of the slave offered for sale, or from
the circle of soldiers 01· bystanders (vulgi stante corona) gathered
round the captives. He prefers the former explanation. A
like phrase is ‘sub hasta ven) from the spear, as a symbol of
the force on which the slavery rested. This has lasted on in
the Subasta=auction in modern Italian.
