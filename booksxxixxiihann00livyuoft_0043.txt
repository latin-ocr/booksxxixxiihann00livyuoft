Upon eareful scrutiny it may be seen that in
many passages of the two writers there is very close
resemblance in the language used, more especially in
dealing with the first part of the war. The agree-

to chance, or to faithful rendering only of the facts.

At first therefore it was thought, as by Lachmann
and by others, that the later author Livy must have
copied freely from Polybius, though without acknow-
ledging his debts, or even mentioning him by name
until the end (XXX. 45. 4). We can lay little stress
indeed upon this silence, for ancient writers had no
scruples in using the materials which they found
ready to their hands 3 they borrowed often largely
from each other, and had no delicacy of feeling
about such debts of honour. But there is good
reason for believing that the view just stated is not
an adequate explanation of the facts.
