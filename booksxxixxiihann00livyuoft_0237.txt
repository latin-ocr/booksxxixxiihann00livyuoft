NOTES. XXI. c. xm. 54—0. xiv. §3- 171

5 4. Postquam...est. ‘Now that there is.¹ A rare se-
quence of tense, as the est is not the historieal present. It
should be postquam eo ventum est ut. Heerwagen compares 30.
5³, postquam multo majorem partem itineris emensam cernant.

§5- culus lta. ‘Some slight hope of which is left pro-
vided that you accept its terms as conquered men, seeing that
Η. dictatos them as a conqueror, and do not think of what you
forfeit as a loss, but of what you are allowed to keep as a free
gift, seeing that all you have is at your conqueror's mercy.’
The change of mood from the audiatis of the MSS. which
most editors retain, to habituri estis, can hardly be explained
on any principle, so Madvig reads audietis after Gronovius.

P. 15, ἓ 6. captam habet. A strong form of the perfect
for a completed act, as sessum militem habebat, 11. 3.

ἓ 7. binis. Why this instead of sinyulis, 12. 5, we do not

know, and Lipsius therefore suggested privis as privis tunicis >

donati, v11. 37. 2.

fi 8. Equidem. The e seems to be an intensifying particle
as in edepol (e. deus. Pollux), equit-ine, ecastor, edius Fidius,
another form of medius Fidius. Corssen, 11. 857.

ἓ 9. patienda...slnat1s. Note the change of construction,
patiamini being understood in patienda.

trucidari. Derived by Corssen from truncum coedere, as if

shofirtgzeined from truci-cidare like stipendium for stipi-pendium,
11. .

c. xxv. ἓ 1. paulatim. Like raptim, confestim, this adverb
seems to be an accusative form of an abstract substantive
otherwise lost. Corssen 11. 532 explains paulus, or paullus the
older form, as a diminutive pauo-Mus from a root pauro, pre-
served in παύρος, like misellus, tenellus, διο. for misemlus,

tenerulus. So the name Paulus means ‘the little man’ as
Crassus ‘ the fat man.'

argentum aurumque omne. Livy seems in this chapter to
combine two accounts of the event, one of which emphasized
the tragio despair of the S„ while another reported ingens
prada and captivi. Polybius 111. 17 after a very short ac-
count of the siege dwells on the booty gained. Like stories
of the aelf-destruction of the inhabitants were told in the case

of other Spanish towns in later times. Cf. xxvm. 23, Juv. xv. ’

93. Compare also the sieges of Numantia and Zaragoza.

ἓ 3. momento. More frequently with temporis, or lwroe,
not absolutely, as here and in 111. 63. 1, mv. 22. 9.

crudele. Requires fuit to balance coynitum est, but Livy
often omits iu like cases,
