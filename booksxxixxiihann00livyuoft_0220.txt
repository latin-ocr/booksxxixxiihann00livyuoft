sollicitandis. Connected m‘th Oscan sollus=totu3‚ ὅλος and
salvus, so εοῐίἰεείτηιιε, sollemnis, διο. emesan, 1. 486.

foedus renow Polyb. ιι. 13 gives details of the disquietude
at Rome, and of the wish to attack the growing power in Spain,
which was delayed only by the pressure oi the Gallio war. As
the Romans had no possessione ιιι Spain, to define the limit
of the Hiberus, and to stipulate for Saguntum, was ιιι fact an
insult to the sovereign power oi Carthage. Foedus =foidus is
connected with fides, like πέποιθα with πίστις. Curtius, Gr.
Etym. p. 236, rejects Mommsen’s explanation from sundere,
like σπονδή, spondeo.

ut, ‘on condition that’=e‹p' ᾤ, cf. Polyb.‚ as it was a new
stipulation added to the treaty of 241 13.c., but Pol. does not
mention any provision for Saguntum.

Ρ 3 c. 111. §L In Hasdrubalis locum. There 1s nothing
in the sentence to correspond to these words, Something gmay
have diopped out which referred to them, but more probably
it is one of those cases of which Madvig speaks in his Kleine
Phil. Schr. p. 359, where there is a want of balance and con-
nexion in Livy's artificial periods. He specifies as examples
1. 7. 7 and 1. 46. 1. Fabri quotes as an example of Livy’s
anacolutha, xxvm. 31. 1, Laelius...auditis quae acta Gadibus
erant ...... nuntiis ad L. Marcium missis...redeundum ad impera-
torem esse, adsentiente Marcio paucos post dies ambo Cartha-
9inem rediere.

quin...sequebatur. The MS. reading is here quite corrupt,
especially in quam, where only qua is possible, and in the
omission of the apodosis aiter erat. Drakenborch's reading
praerogativam..,sequeretur makes fair sense, but lays great
sti-ess on the popularity of Hannibal, who could hardly have
been much known by the plebs, although the wealth oi Spain
may have been used to secure adherente at home, and Polybius
says, ὁ δῆμος μιᾷ ’γνώμῃ κυρίαν ἐποίησε τὴν τῶν στρατοπέδων
αἵ εσιν, 111. 13.

Ρριεειοὲατινε.. A metaphor taken from the usage of the
Roman comitia. The tribe on which the lot fen to vote first
often influenced the vote of the wavering, and so the term
carried associations of authority. Cf. 111. 51. 5, ne comitiorum
militarium praeroyatz‘vam sequerentur urbana comitia, add Cio.
Mur. 18. 38, tanta illis comitiis reliyz'o est ut adhuc semper omen
valuerit prcerogyativum.

praetorium. The tent of the Roman general, and so the
head—quartem of the legion3 hence applied to the palace of a
governor, Ev. Mate. xxvii. 27, as also to the quarters of the
