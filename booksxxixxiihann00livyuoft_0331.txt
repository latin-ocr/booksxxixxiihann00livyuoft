NOTES. XXII. c. xvm. §8-0, mx. §8- 263

imperio...consfflo are less properly connected with agens
than precibus. but the same construction is repeated xxiv. 32. 5.

ξ 9. It might perhaps be better to put a comma after
hostis, and to assume an ellipse of ‘he should remember' before
medicos. Cf. Cic. Tusc. 1. 17. 41, horum iyitur aliquid animus
est, ne tam veqeta mens aut in corde cerebrove...jaceat.

quiete. ‘By doing nothing.’ Cf. xxr. 10. 3, nec unquam
quietura Romana foedera.

5 10. haec n. praern. These words sum up the foregoing
advice of Fabius, and link together the earlier clauses with the
final profectus.

c. xxx. ξ 3. carthag. Nova C. or Cartagena.

naves. The reading of Madvig makes the construet.
simplet than the navibus of the MSS„ which is awkward ir
taken with prof„ and would require ducebat to bear the mean-
ing ‘had the...rnfl.rched.’ Polyb. has ταῖς μὲν ναυσὶ παρὰ τὴν
χέρσον ἐποιεῖτο τὸν πλοῦν, τοῖς δὲ πεζοῖς τὴν πορείαν παρὰ. τὸν
αἰγιαλόν, 111. 95. Navibus probably grew out of navis (naves),
as in 1211. 43. 4 habentibus from habentis.

ἓ 4. idem consilii, i.e. confliyere as above.

l· ingentem... Taken by hypallaqe with f., not with auxi-
zorum.

ς 5. Massiliensmm. Polyb. notes the general zealousness
of Massilia in the Roman cause throughout the war.

speculatorias. Non sunt triremes sed ‘naves minores sine
rostris ut constat ex Liv. xxxvr 42, Drakenb. ap. Fabri.

P. 96, ς 6. universo terrore. ‘ General panic.'

effus& 7Livy more often uses offusus with terror. cf.
xxvur. . .

ἓ 7. nondum...aper1entibus. A bold constr., in which the
negative sense is transferred from the verb to the adverb:
‘ still hiding.’ Cf. also xxu. 6. 9, quum...dispulsa nebula ape-
ruisset diem. There is nothing in Polyb. to answer to this
rhetorical description of the confusion, though the accounts
otherwise agree.

· ἷξε classem esse...follows a verb ‘announce,' understood
m J e .

num minus quam...exspect. A very favourite phrase of
Livy which often occurs.
