in altum, often used for tho sea. but seldom of a river.

ς 12. deiectis rect. Polyb. 111. 46 says that the Indian
drivers of these were drowucd. He gives a lively picture οὶ
them making their way across, each with its proboscis raised
alost above the suriaco of the water: the rest of his narrative
agrees with that of Livy, but he is clearer in the details, and
he reserves the passage of the elephants till H. continues his
march.

c. xxrx. ἓ 1. traflciuntur miserat. The sequence of
tenses is harsh. Fabri compares 1x. 32. 1, dum hoec yeruntur
in Samnio, Jam omnes Etruriae populi ad arma ierant.

P, 31, 5 2. atrocius quam pro numero. A form often used
by Livy, cf. 59. 9, major quam pro numero jactura, xxxv1. 10.
12, latius quam pro copiis, where pro has the meaning of ‘in

ς 3. amplius ducenti. The omission of quam between
amplius, minus, plus and the numeral in the nominativo is a
common feature of Livy's style.

nec scipioni. ‘S could not' decide on any plan, save that

sententia stetit. Polyb. makes him start at once in pursuit of
H. after his cavalry return from reconnoitring the camp of Η.

§ 6. cum eo qul...exercitus. Note the attraction of subject

to the relative clause as Hor. Sat. 1. 4. 2, alii quorum Comoedia
pmcn virorum.

avertit In Polyb. there is a. graphio picture of the
appearance of the Gauls at the camp of H.‚but their arguments
seem addressed rather to the soldiers than their general, whose
mind was long made up to push on with all speed for Italy,
especially as the season was advanced. He sends his cavalry
down the river to hold the Romans in check while his elephants'
crossed, and the infantry pushed on. Great as might be the
risk of the passage through the Alps, and Hannibal could
scarcely have foreseen it all, yet Cisalpine Gaul was the only
side from which Italy was vfflnerable, now that Rome was
mistress of the sea. There was a population akin in race to
