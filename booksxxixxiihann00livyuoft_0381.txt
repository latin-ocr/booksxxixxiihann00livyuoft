ROUTE OF HANNIBAL. 313

soldiers' strength among the friendly Gaula, and then at their
request made war upon the tribe whose town bequeathed its
mune, if not its site, to the Turin of modern times. It was
commonly torgotten that he had been invited to the Po by the
discontented Gauls, of whom the Insubres were the foremost
olan, and that their guides would naturally lead him first to
their own cantons, before they urged him to attack their
neighbours.

To sum up then, it seems most probable, nay almost certain
that the route adopted by the Roman writer was that from
the Drbme to the Durance, and across the Mont Genevre, the
Alpes Gottiae of the Roman Empire. It is also probable, though
less evidmt, that Polybius believed the army to have made a
longer circuit by the Rhone and the Tarentaise, across the
Graian Alps, or what is now the Littlc St Bernard. If the two
historians really are at issue, there is little doubt whose au-
thority should stand the higher, as the earlier had higher
qualities as an historian, and had made more special studies on
this subject. General probabilities also are in favour oi the
. easier, the lower, the better known, and the more favourably
placed of the two passes. If any however prefer to think that
the two accounts can be forced into agreement,—-and most
critice hitherto have assumed that this is possible—then it
should be remembered that definite data in the form of proper
names occur only in the account of Livy, and the problem
must be to reconcile the earlier conditione in Polybius with the
outlet through the Mont Genevre. With the narrative of Livy
we may probably connect the account of Varro above quoted,
which distinguishes the route of Hannibal from that across the
Graian Alps, and which may be due to reasoning from like
data. He can-ies Pompeius by a different road to Spain, as does
Sallust also in the fragment (Hist. 111. 3) where he puts into
that general’s mouth the words Per Alpes iter, aliud atque
Hannibal, nobis opportunius patefeci. But the statements in
these cases are too vague to be critically haudled.

It only remains now to deal with a third route—that over
the Mont Cenis-which has found learned champions to ad-
vocate its claims. It should be stated at the outset that it is
not certame referred to by any ancient author, and there is no
good evidence that it was known or used before the eighth
century of our era when Pepin marched across it; but this is
not of course conclusive, for Hannibal may have been guided
over a. pass that was else scarcely known, and Latin writers
say too little of the Alps to enable us to reason surely from
their silence in this case. But it is important to observe that
the natural construction of our authors fails to suit the theory,
at least in the form in which it is presented by its chief sup-
portora, M. Laranza, Dr Ukert and Mr Ellis. These· writers,
