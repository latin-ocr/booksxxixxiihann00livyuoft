pohrtray the boding fears, and the readiness to listen to such
st01·ies; elsewhere he speaks of the negligentia qua nihil deos
portendere nunc credunt, yet Dion Cassius, one of the devoutest
of historiaus, inserts like lists centuries later.

ξ 2. foro olitorio. The herb market was between the
Capitoline hill and the Tiber3 the temple of Spes just be-
yond the porta Carmentalis was twice burnt down and restored.

triumphum clam. The common cry was Io triumphe, pro-
bably here referred to. Cf. xxm. 10. 4, infantem in utero matris
Io triumphe clamasse. Hor. Carm. 1v. 2. 50. Triumphus is a
Latinized form of θρίαμβος.

Ρ, 69, §3. f. boario. Between the Circus Maximus and
the Tiber, one of the most erowded thoroughsares m Rome.

in aedem Iunonis, i.e. of Juno Sospita xxn. 1. 17, whose

modo scd etiam (οἱ) emeritis stipendiis (ὄντες).

Caere, now Cervetri (Coere vetus), often mentioned as the
scene oi prodigies. Its religious associatione with Rome were
of early date, and are connected with the story of the Vestal
Virgins taking refuge there from the Gauls. Festus' deriva-
tion of caeremonia from it, sancitu] as it is, points in the same
direction.

sortes extenuatas. The sortes which thus ‘shrunk’ were
slips of wood, on which proverbial phrases were written in
archaic letters, and from which one or more were drawn at
random when advice or guidance might be needed; cf. Cic. de
divin. 11. 41. 69. The most famous were at Praeneste, 111 the
temple of Fortuna, but in the lst Punic war a consul, who

In the Corpus Inscr. Lat. 1. 267 are copies of a. number
