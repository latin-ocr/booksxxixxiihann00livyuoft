238 NOTES. XXI. c. Lxm. ὃς 7-14,

mutarunt vastem et sinna {minuerunt paludatus dicitur pro-
ficisci, Varro, 1. l. 7. 37.

cons. spretorum (sc. Deorum a. hom). The reading of
Gronovius for conscientias proetorum of MSS.

votorum nunc. One ot the first ceremonies on the day of
taking office (die initi may.) was to go to the Capitol with
kinsmen and friends, to sit upon the curule chair, and thank
Jupiter opt. max. for the mercies of the past year, offering
the victims promised by the out-going consuls, and vowing
others for the year to follow (vot. nuncupatio). They then
presided over a meeting of the senate on the Capitol, treating
chiefly de solemni reliyione. Polyb. says nothing of this con-
duct of Flaminius, nor does Appian. It reads like an after-
thought, coloured by patrioian prejudjees, to account ior the
disaster which followed.

ἓξ). clam furtim. A pleonasm, like forte temere, and
other repetitions used by Livy.

P. 71. exim causa. Our word ⁴ exile' calls up different
associations. At Rome a citizen could give up the rights and
duties of citizenship and take up his residence in an allied
community which had the relation of ἰσοπολιτεία with Rome,
like the Latin states. This privilege, called exilium, might
be used even during prosecution for political offences, and the
accused might thus anticipate the issue of his trial.

ξ 10. Romae mag. init. Though irregular, this was not
invalid. Augustus oareful as he was of constitutional forms,
did not observe the rule. Sueton. 26, nec omnes (consulatus)
Romae sed quartum consulatum in Asia, quintum insula Samo,
octavum et nonum Tarracone iniit.

ἓ 12. nihilo magis... The constitution gave the senate no
power to dictate to the consuls, though the executive officials
rarely ventured to set at nought the authority of so august a
body. Flaminius was anticipating the policy oi the Gracchi
in ttrying to humble the senate, and depend on popular sup-
por .

moverunt...moverant. The Latin ear seems to have liked
such repetitions of the same word, as they frequently occur.

ἓ 13. immolanti ei, &e A frequent omen of ill-luck.
Gt. a like case of J. Caesar, Sueton. 59, licet immolanti ausu-
9tssct hostia prosectionem...non distulerit.

· ξ14. 111 omen acc. For the use of the preposition‚ of.
Cic. ad Att. xv. 11, beneficium accepisse in contumeliam.
