THE TEXT AND ORTHOGRAPHY OF
LIVY1.

ΤΗΕ oldest MS. of the third decade of Livy is that
which is preserved in the N ational Library at Paris,
under the name of the Codex Puteanus (P), dating
probably from the beginning of the eighth century.
In the earlier edition (1860) of the Emendationes
Livianae, Madvig came to the conclusion that this
was the source of all the extant MSS„ which he
believed to differ from it only in the various errors
due to the carelessness of later copyists. But the
researches of Mommsen and Studemund have thrown
light on the influence of another Codex called Spi-
rensis (S), from which a number of readings were
noted down long ago by Beatus Rhenanus but which
has since disappeared with the exception of a single
leaf discovered a few years back (O. Halm in Act.
