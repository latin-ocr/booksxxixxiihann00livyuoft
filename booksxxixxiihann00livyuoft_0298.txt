to relieve the Gauls of the burden of maintaining his army,
but it is most likely that he wanted to open communicatione
with the Carthaginian fleet, which had orders to oruise off
Pisae (Pol. 111. 96). He probably moved by a shorter pass
towards the coast, rather than that which he traversed later
in the spring. This movement may account for the fact that
Sempronius took up his winter quarters at Luca, to watch the
outlets os the maritime Alps, and. to protect the coast road to

Rome.

vertice intorti affligebantur. ‘ Were dashed to the ground
by the wliirlwind.’ The use of a participle in Latin for a
prepos. as in ira, misericordia motus, &a is very common: the
use of intorti seems an extension of the same idiom, the dis-
tinctive meaning of the word being really part of the idea of
the vertar, cf. Nagelsbaeh 330. Yet the phrase is used else-
where as in xxvm. 30. 13, navem videre vertice retro intortam.
For the meaning of verteae see Quintil. vm. 2. 7, vertex est con-
torta in se aqua vel quiequid aliud similiter vertitur. For afflige·
bantur, cf. the old reading in 35. 12.

ἓ 6. capti auribus. Cf. 11. 36. 11, captus omnibus membris,

P, 65, ἓ 9. extollere...1evare. Most of the MSS. have
attollere, for which Heerwagen compares Verg. AEn. rv. 690,

graphio term, expressive of the effort to rise from the strayes.

ἓ 10. movere is used after coepere understood in est coeptus.

onem...1nop5. Cf. Hor. Carm. 111. 16. 28, maynas inter
opes wops.

§lL elephanti. Polyb. says that only one survived the
eold and storms at Trebia, but probably he is anticipating the
result of the year's campaign.

e. mx. g 1. There is something rather meaningless in the

movements of H. towards Placentia and in general too much
seems to be compressed into the short winter, as the battle of
Trebia could not have been fought before December. Polyb.

ignores all these operations.
g 3. vincerent, i. 6. Romam· understood in res Romana.
