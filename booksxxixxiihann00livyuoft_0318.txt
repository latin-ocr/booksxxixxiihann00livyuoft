250 NOTES. XXII. c. vm. ἐξ 4-6.

§4. extenuatis. A substantive, like ‘exhausti0n‚'is im-
pilgegl icilxntlzllssse word to balance magnitudine. Cf. xm. 1. 5, Sici-

§ 5. ad remedium. Cf. note on 9. 7.

dictatorem dic. The dictator was appointed probably at
first in times of urgent danger, when a general-in-chief was
needed who would not be controlled by the rivalry of a col-
league, or the veto of a tribune. To this we may refer the
limit oi the six months' tenure of office, the early name of
maqz'ster populi, or lcader of the army (cf. Herzog, populari‚)
with the subordinate 71zc19ister equitum, and the fact that the
appointment in times of civil struggle was regarded as a pro-
clamation of state of siege, or martial law, though in later
days dictator-s, no longer optimo jure, were subject to the veto
of the tribune. The comitia had commonly no power of
clecti0n3 the senate by virtue of their general authority
commonly decided on the step, but the appointment (dicere)
formally rested with a consul, who by lot or arrangement with
his colle-agne rose at the dead of night, within the boundaries
of Roman αῃον, and named the temporary head of the exe-
cutive. The latter name was probably, as Mommsen thinks,
borrowed by analogy from the dictators of the Latin towns,
who had succeeded to the position of the King.

nec dict. populo (non consulto senatus). The Puteanus
has populo only, other MSS. populus. An early critic changed
this to praetor, as inconsistent with what immediately follows.
Madvig prefers to think that words have dropped out as in
other places in this book, but the correction seems a bold one.
There can be little doubt however that he is right 'm rejecting
prodictamrem, which some editors read on the ground that
Livy adopts the view that Fabius was only prodiet. 31. 8), for
(1) the form prodt'ctatore would have been used, as t e phrase*
was too uncommon to become a substantive like proconsul, (2)
the later passage looks like an after-thought of criticism‚ quite
consistent with a different view in this passage. It is probable
that a ῥητέον must have presided at the ComitIa, and declared
the dictator elected, and J. Caesar acted on this precedent in1
ac. 48, though it was regarded as irregular. Cf. Cic. ad. Att.
9. 15. 3, volet consules royet proetor vel dictatorem dicat, quorum
neutrumjus est, sed si Sulla potuit efficere ab interreqe ut ἀΐοιεν
tor diceretur, cur hic non possit. Mommsen arbitrarily decides
to strike this clause out oi the text. Cf. C. Ι. L. 1. p. 288.

ot his house still bore the cognomen διὰ τὰς ἐκείνου τάνδρὸς ἐπι-
