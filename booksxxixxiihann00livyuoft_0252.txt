186 NOTES. XXI. c, xxv, §g 2-8,

called, consisting entirely of citizens, and planted especially
upon the coast, οι· on the great roads, to bar the way of an
invader; and the Latin, in which the peoples of Latium, and
of other allied races, were invited to take part, which were
settled on ground lately won‚ and ser-ved as garrisons on a
disputed frontier. These were therefore doubly useful, as
holding in check dangerous enemies, and as pledges for the
fidelity of old allies, who could look only to Rome for help in

their distant homes.

ξ 3. triumvir-1. Commissioners were commonly appointed
to direct the work of the ayrimensores‚ which was carried out
with scrupulous nicety on traditional principles, and to assign
the allotments‚ the size of which was determined by the
senate or commonS. Polyb. 111. 40 says that there were 6000
colonists in each, and that they were directed to be on the
spot within 30 days, Note the anomaly of the form triumviri,
duumviri, which grew probably out of the use of the singular
triumvir, as one of a board of three.

Mutina was itself a Roman colony, Polyb. 111. 40, though
Livy states that it was colonized with Parma in 184 Β. c.
(L. xxxm. 55). That the Romans chose well the sites of their
colonies is illustrated by the importance of the towns of
Modena, Piacenza and Cremona.

ξ 5. Id quoque dubium. As the walls were already built,
there seems reason to doubt whether the commission was not
sent for some other purpose than to assign the allotments.
