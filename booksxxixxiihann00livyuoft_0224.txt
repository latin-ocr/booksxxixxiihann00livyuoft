religio is the sense oi the unseen world as a binding or
constraining force (whether from religyare, as in Lucretius,
reliyionum nodis exsolvere, or from wlmare, as Cicero N. D.

The absolute use of juwnyendo seems very awkward, and Usener
suggests aliud aycnclo quasi tractus, but Fabri illustrates this
