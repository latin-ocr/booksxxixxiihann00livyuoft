such a ver sacrum had been vow'ed among the Sabine hius,
and that when the young of that spring reached man's estate
they were sent forth in search of some new homes, and that
guided on their several paths by animals sacred to the Italian
Mars, they made their way into Samnium and Picenum, and
to other lands, where they accepted henceforth as their
national symbols, the bull in Samnium, the woodpecker (picus)
in Picenum, and the wolf for the Hirpini, whose forefathers
had been led by it to their new homes. In the case above re-
ferred to the senate gave its sanction to the vow, but the Chief
Pontiff was aware that ancient usage required the consent of
the whole people, and a bill was drawn up by his instructions,
to be submitted to the vote in the comitia. It was drawn up
with scrupulous care that no little fiaw, or unforeseen neglect,
might vitiate the people’s form of intercession, and indeed it

Licinian laws—-to divide among the needy much of the state
domain available in Cisalpine Gaul (B.c. 231). The nobles in
the senate stoutly opposed the measure, which was carried
through the comitia in spite of their resistance.

The sanction of the senate was not technically needed to
give a plebiscitzmz force of law, and the egotism of the govern-
ing classes may have justified this bold innovation of Flami-
nius, but it was a violent blow against the representative power
in the state, and as such was noted by Polybius (11. 21) as the
first ominous sign of constitutional decline. The aristocracy
submitted with ill grace, and hampered him in his work 01
