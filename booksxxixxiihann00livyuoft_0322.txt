254 NOTES. XXII. c. x. §g G-lo.

24. 0, sarcitis vr. 41. 63 so occisit ΧΠ. tab„ rapsit Cic. Leg. 11. 9.
22, vixec, for conj. plusqu., Verg. AEn. xx. 118, extinzem AEn.
1v. 606, confluxet Luer. 1. 987, surrexe Hor. Sat. 1. 9. 73, traxe
AEn. v. 786. So also such forms as acclarassis Liv. 1. 18. 7,
habessit Cic. Leg. 11. 8. 19, and many like forms in Plautus.
It seems probable that conj. and 11. fut. forms like faxim,
saxo are derived from an old perfect form in -si rather than
from a reduplicated form in -ί,

faxitur is a still more curious form of 2nd. fut. passive sor
sactum erit, like jnssitar for jussum erit Cato R. R. 14, turbas-
st'tur for turbatus erit Cic. Leg 111. 4. 11, mercassz'tur for mer-
catus erit Lex Agrar. Ο. 200. 71. Cf. Corssen, 11. 555.

antidea, an old form for antea, like postidea for postea,
antid being the early form of ante. Cf. the ablative forms
marid, ηαυαῑὶιί, dictatored, διο. found in early inscriptions, as
also med, ted, scd, red, found singly or in composition.

P, 85, ς 7. ludi magm. This term was afterwards re·
sei-ved for the extraordinary ludi in distinction to the regular
which were called Itali Romani. The sums were voted by the
senate, butas they were often inadequate, great expense was
constantly incurred by the cedi les on whom the arrangements
fell, and at the end of the Republic the outlay was often
rumous.

aeriS. This was probably the ces ,aravo or librat as, which
had been successively reduced in wolght to that of 8. triens in
the lst Pimic war, and to the uncia in this year (Q. Fabio
dictatore asses unciales facti, Pliny 33. 3. 45), but in laws and
state coneerns the old monetary system was for a long time
retained, and the nummus sestertius was employed as its equi-
valent in silver. Cf. Mommsen Miinzw. 292 and VVeissenborn's
note.

trecentis t. It was a Roman fancy that the odd num-
bers found favour with the gods of the upper air, while the
Manes or the powers oi the lower world liked the even best.
Thus the fixed holidays, serice stativae, were nearly all on the
odd days of the Calendar.

ἓ 10. Veneri Erycinae. This deity was probably the Phoe-
nician Astarte, whose worship may be traeed (under the
name of Aphrodite) in many places where an earlier influence
was adopted by the Greeks. Eryx, as we know, was one
oi the points of Sicily to which the Carthaginians clung most
obstinately. Its traditions were in com-se of time worked
into the legends of the Trojan war, its deity confused with
the goddess mother oi AEneaS, whose wanderings are made
