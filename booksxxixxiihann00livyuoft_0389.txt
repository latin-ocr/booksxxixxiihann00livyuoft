CHARAOTER OF 0. FLAMJNIUS. 321

wards the government of Sicily fell to his lot as Praetor, and
there is reason to believe that he endeared himself to the
provincials by clean-handed justice (Livy xxxu1. 42). His pro-
motion to the consulship did not follow till 222, when he
endeavoured to crush the Cisalpine Gauls‚ already defeated at
L. Telamon, by invading the country of the Insubres. In the
only account of the campaign which we possess (Polyb. 11. 32)
he appears to have been wanting in good saith towards the
Gauls, and by the neglect of the common rules of strategy to
have risked probable disaster, from which he was saved only
by the steady valour of the legionaries and the iorethought of
the military tribunes,

Before the campaign was over he was summoned by the
senate to resign his office, on the ground oi some technical
flaw in his election, but he would not open the despatch till
the victory was won‚ and on his return persisted in entering
Rome in forms of triumph, despite the refusal of the senate.

The resentment oi the nobles was intense, and they forced
a dictator to resign, who had been bold enough to name
Flaminius as his Master of the Horse. But it is to the credit
' of the latter, that in his censorship of 219 he did not stoop to
any petty J'ealousies of rival parties, only linking the memories
of that high office with the Circus, and the great Highway
which bore his name in after ages.

But it was partly due to his support that the bill of Claudius
was passed, which forbade the Senatorian families to own mer-
chant vessels, a law which rested no doubt in part on the
aristocratic preiudice of old societies, but aimed also at pro-
tecting the provincials from sinister action on the part oi
Roman governors in the interest of Roman traders. If his
generalship really was so questionable in the Gallio war, it is
strange that he should have been re-elected to the consulship
after the disaster of the Trebia.

There are reasons too for doubting the account os Livy
which makes him leave Rome and enter office at Ariminum in
contempt of all customary scruples, though military needs
might well excuse neglect of purely formal duties. But Poly-
bius is quite silent on the subject, though his informants had
no love for Flaminius, and a legal measure, called probably
Les Flaminia minus solvendi, seems to point to the presence
of the consul in the capital, although the evidence is not con-
clusive. The financial policy which it suggests accords indeed
with his other measures in favour of the poorer classes, at
the expense also of the wealthier.

'Hie position of Flaminius at Arretium seems to have been
well chosen for defence, and his plans were probably suggested
by the campaign against the Gauls in 224. He must have
heard of Hannibal's advance, and have shown no wish to
