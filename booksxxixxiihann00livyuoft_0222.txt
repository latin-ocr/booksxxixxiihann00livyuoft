ἓ 6. Ego. Cf. Donatus ap. Drakenb. semper ,qravis inceptio
orationis quae exordium sumit a pronomine eqo.

quandoque is commonly used by Livy in the sense of
‘ since‚' or ‘ whenever! Here the indefinite meaning ‘at some

time or other ’ grows out of the elliptical use ‘ whenever it may
be,’ following ne as it follows quoad in Cic. Fam. 6. 19 quoad
ille quandoque veniat. Tacitus however, Ann. vr. 20, uses
it in this indefinite sense by itself, et tu Galba quandoque de·
,qustabis imperium.

c. 1v. ξ 1. maior pars. Note the admission that the
partisans of H. were the majority in the senate. It was not
therefore merely a popular party, supported by the army,
which dragged the country against its will into a war with
Rome, according to the theory maintained by Fabius Pictor,
and refuted by Polyb. 111. 8, though in later days H. may have
been accused by his political opponents as responsible for all
the losses of the war, and Livy puts this charge into the mouth
of the ambassadors of Carthage, xxx. 22. 1, eum injussu senatus
non Alpes modo sed Hiberum quoque transm-essum.

In optimus, meliorem, we have traces of the old confusion
so common in classical literature, by which moral terme are
used to distinguish political parties. Cf. the use of ἐπιεικεῖς,
βέλτιστοι, σοφοί, πολιτεύειν σωφρονέστερον in Thucydides, who
speaks of the unscrupulous Antiphon as ἀρετῇ οὐδενὶ ὕστερος.

ἕ2. Hamilc. iuvenem. Hamilcar was very young in the
lst Punic war, and died in the prime of life. Cf. Soph.
Philoct. κᾶμ’ εὐθὺς ἐν κύκλῳ στρατὸς Ι ἐκβάντα πᾶς ἠσπάζετ’
ὀμνύντες βλέπειν Ι τὸν οὐκ ἔτ’ ὄντα ζῶντ’ Ἀχιλλέα πάλιν.

credere...intueri. The historic infinitives here give vigour
and liveliness to the passage.

P, 4, lineamenta. Linea is connected with littera, lino,
from a root sli=smear‚ found in our slime, Corssen 1. 383.

pater in se ‘His father’s memory was but little needed
to gain the popular good will‚' or, ‘his likeness to his father
was but the least infiuence,’ dec„ i. e. was only the least among
many influences. For use of momentum cf. 1. 47. 4, ipsa reyio
semiue orta nullum momentum in dando adimendoque reyno
jaceret. From the early meaning of the ‘weight which turned
the scale,' movimentmn, came secondary meanfflgs, as in the
parallel cases of yravis, sex-ius, both of which first denoted
physical weight‚ and then moral.

ἓ 3. discerneres, a use of the imperf. subi„ frequent
in Livy, where the pluperf. would seem more naturalto uS, as
11. 43. 9, crederes victos. The earlier part of this description
seems too enthusiastic to have come from a Roman annalist5
