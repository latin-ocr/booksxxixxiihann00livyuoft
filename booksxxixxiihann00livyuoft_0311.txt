Arretium. A position of great importunae ns commanding
the valley oi tho Arno and the passos oi the Apennines, and
thus covering Rome from attack on either side. But the scouts
should have ascertained the route of H. in time for Servilius
to have murched to joiu his collengue, and then the R. lines
should have been extended irom Cortona to Clusium.

§2- aliud longius. Several other routes were possible
and longer, but most of the passos across the Western moun-
tains converged on Luna (the guli oi Spezzia), or on Luca,
both of which had been probably sortified and garrisoned by
Sempronius, and behind them on the coast road to Rome lay
the strongly intrenched town of Pisoe. H. seems therefore to
have ehosen the shorter pass by Pistorin. and the valley of the
Arno, by what was afterwards the Via Cassia from Florentia to
Arretium. The easier course by the AEmilian and Flaminiam
ways was avoided from the proximity of the Roman armies,
or from tho wish to relieve at once the country of the Gauls.
Possibly the marshes of the Arno were then more widely ex-
tended, or the inundations of the Arno greater, as the time
spent seems strangely long; but the fau in the valley is very
slight, and the inundatione caused by the overflow of the
Arno and its tributaries are still iormidable.

53. admixtis imped. Η. was not eoneerned usually,
says Polyb. 111. 79, about his baggage, except in so iar as the
