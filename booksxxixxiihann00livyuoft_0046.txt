the features of resemblance are most marked, are

spirit of the soenes, and the fortunes of his soldiers
are described in most detail.

They deal with the march of the invading army,
with the fields of battle, and the vicissitudes of the
campaigns. The touches here are often very delicate
and minute, and the narrative is that of an eyc-

to last in Hannibal's campaigns (Corn. Nepos, Hamz.
13) and to have written with great care the history
of his wars (Cic. de Dicin. 1. 24), and as such is
quoted as an authority by Livy (XXVI. 49. 3). Con-
