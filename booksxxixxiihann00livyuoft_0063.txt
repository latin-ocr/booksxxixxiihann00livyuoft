INTROD UC'TION. IV. liii

J. Caesar, who set the fashion of writing maximus, &c
Quintil. 1. 7. ξ 21.

Ε. Ι. Livy wrote sibe, quase, and many in the
first century did likewise, Quint. 1. 7. §24 So tho
abl. of words like aqilis, Vimimlis was written at the
end of the Republic with a final e. The elder Pliny
proposed to write ayile of persons, aqizi of things.
J. Caesar decided for the i, to distinguish abl. from
neut. nom„ but it did not definitely prevail till the
end of the century.

The form of the acc. plur. gave critics much
trouble in the varieties of eis, is, es. It seems to
have been settled that is was the commoner ending
in words whose sing. nom. and gen. ended in -is, like
omnis, navis, or of nominatives in -er with abl. in i, as
cicer,- in words in ns, rs, like sons, par3,· while words
in as, x more frequently assumed a plur. in es. The
account of the grammarians that the gen. plurals in
ium were followed by acc. plur. in is requires correc-
tion in this respect.

In the acc. sing. there was also a wavering be-
tween im and em, and the i prevailed only in Greek
words, and a very few feminines.

I (pingue). The broad i sound was under the
Republic commonly written ei, which ceased in the
August-,an age, though grammarians recognized it
much later.

IL sse doubling of ’ἰ between two vowels was
preferred by Cicero, as in adio, M aiia, and inscriptions
