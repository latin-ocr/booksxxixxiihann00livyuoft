256 NOTES. XXII. c, XI. 57—0. ΧΠ. ς4.

§ 7. ad urbem R. Probably as W. suggests in the doek-
yards or in course of building.

ἓ 8. libertini. The slaves of a Roman, when freed, were
called his liberti, and passed into the class of libertini. These
were by Q. Fabius in 303 13.c. all enrolled in the 4 urbanae tribus.
where their votes counted for little, but in later days repeated
efforts were made by the popular leaders to spread them over
the rusticae tribus where they might own land. They could
not serve regularly in the legions, for military service was
regarded at Rome as the privilege and duty oi the free land-
owners. and it was not until the time of Marius that this senti-

ment disappeared.

qulbus liber1. This condition recnrs in other cases, asin
the privilege allowed to Latini to migrate to Rome and become
R. citizens if they lest children behind them, and in usages of
preeedence among magistrates.

aetfas militaris. i.e. commonly from the 17111 to the 46th
year ο age.

§9. urbano ex. Referring to the lower estimate of the
urbanae tribus who formed what was called contemptuously
sorensis sactiO.

e. xri. ἓ 1. quo diem. Neai-ly all the MSS. read quodie, a
,κ mistake which probably grew out of a failure to see that quo
follows conveniendum, as Tibur does in 11. 4.

g 2. Praeneste is explained by Corssen 11. 216, as being an
old superlative form, as maaianai· or minister are comparatives
like λαλίστερος, thus Praeneste = ‘that which stands forth most
prominently,’ for prce cf. note below on pristinus. Festus
says it was 50 named quia montibus prevenit, and in fact it
commands a splendid view of the neighbourhood os Rome.

transversis lim. ‘Cross-roads,’ as in 11. 39 transversis tra-
mitibus and v. 16. 4 obliquis tramitibus in the same sense. 11
would seem as if trames (trane. meare) were nearly the same
as transversus, while limes (for lie-mes, connected with limus,
λέχριος, limen, a eroes-bearn for lintei) comes from the same
root as obliquus. Corssen, 1. 499.

egressus. W. aptly remarks that the τίω were raised as
causeways higher than the eroes—reads.

exploratis. Corssen connects plorare with pluere pluvia as
‘to make 10 flow' and hence explorare ‘to cause to flow out’
or ‘bring to light,’ 1. 361.

P. 87, ξ 4. quos appears in most MSS„ but it is obviously
corrupt, W. suggests aliquando, Heerwagen antiquos. It seems
better to strike it out.
