Spoleto still bears the name of Porta di Annibale, or Porta
Fuga, in memory of this gallant resistance, and on it are the
words Annibal Spoleto Ι Magna suorum coede repulsus l insiyni
fuya portoe nomen jecit. These are of modern date, but in the
Guildhall is a mutilated inscription, of which the following
words remain. Populus siqua vovit ...... laribusque dedicavit

haud maximae minime ι). Most editors read haud nimis
p. aspere, for the h. minime p. of the MSS. Madvig rejects this

after which minime prospere will follow well enough.
