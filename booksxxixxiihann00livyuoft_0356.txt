Ρ, 124, §8. pum, referring to the auspicia ez tripudiis
The pulli were kept' in evely camp, and fed before the battle3
if any food fell from their mouths to the ground it was a
favourable sign (tripudium solistimum). This could easily be
arranged by the pullarius, who could starve the chieken⁵s to
make them seed greedily. Cf. Cic. de Div. 11. 35. 73, inclusa
in cavea et enecta fame si in offam pultis invadit, et si aliquid
ex ejus ore cecidit, hoe tu auspicium...putas.

trate could forbid a lower to note any signs at a time when he
wished to aet himself (ne quis mayistratus minor de caelo ser-
vasse velit), and there could be no such eollision as in the
present case by what was called obnuntiatio or report of
unlucky omens to stop proceedings.
