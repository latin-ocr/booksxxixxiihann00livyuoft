colleges. This is almost the only form of monumenta] evi-
dence which he cared to consult, or at any rate to copy. For

ς 2. duellis. An archaic form for bellis retained in per-
duellis, as bes stands for dues, and bonus for dnonas. The
Latum donum of the MSS. would be an awkward pleonasm,
and is well corrected by Madvig to tum duit the old snbj. cf.
x. 19. 12 the prayer si hodie victoriam duis. Cf. also adduit,
venum duit, from root ἄψ, another form of -ᾶα, like the forms,
creduis, creduit in Plautus. Corssen, 11. 402. The transposi-
tion of quod duellum, to make it follow immediately hisce
duellis is due to Lipsius, and makes good sense of what is

tamea by w.

ς 3. ver. Reckoned by the pontifices as lasting through

ξ 6. 81 atro die f. The atri dies were those associated iu
memory with some great national disaster as that at Allia or
on the Cremera or at Cannae. On them temples were all
closed and no sacrifices could be offered, and land and busi-
ness were at a standstin. Yet even here the pontifis claimed
dispensing power, and when Ti. Coruncanius fixed by an over·
sight a holiday upon a dies ater, the College ratified his act,
colleyium decrevit non habendum reliyioni quin eo die serice
essent (A, Gen. rv. 6. 10).

laxit. The characteristic vowel is dropped frequently in
the perf. subi. and 11. fut. ind. of this word, especially in
Plautus, Terence, and occasionally in later poets as Verg. AEn.
