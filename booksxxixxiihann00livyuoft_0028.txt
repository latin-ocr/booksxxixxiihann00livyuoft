passage in the straitS. She enrolled the Mamertines
as her allies, and sent a general to the rescue, who by
dexte-rous use of wiles and force ousted the Cartha-

them in the field, and Hiero, who had little to hope

he dreaded least. But the war in Sicily could not be
decided by hard fighting on the open field. A period
of slow sieges followed, and Rome's success was more
thau balanced by the fleets of privateers which ravaged
the coasts of Italy and ruined all its trade, while
Carth-age was mistress of the seas. Then Rome de-
cided to create a navy. She could not raise at once
skilled sailors to manoeuvre with precision, and more

enable them to grapple and board each ship that came
alongside, and to decide the battle by sheer weight of
discipline and numbers. Her navy so constructed ”
swept the scas, and landed her legions under Regulus
almost within sight of Cmthage, but the rash confi-
dence of general and senate while dictating haughty
terius of peace kept the weakened army long inactive,
to be crushed at length by overpowering numbers.
