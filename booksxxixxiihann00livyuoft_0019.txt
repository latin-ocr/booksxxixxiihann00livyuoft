[Ν the earliest-1 times of which history can take ac-
count we find the traces of an active trade in the
Mediterranean waters which was mainly in the hands
of the Phoenician merchants. The enberprising race

which peopled the narrow strip of Canaan hemmed in

world. Its colonists pushed their way along the
coast of Asia Minor, and through the isles of the
AEgean, planting their facfiories on every favour-ed
spot, and opening up the mineral wealth or purple
fisheries of the countries on their way ς their inter-
cha'nge of national products gave the first stimulus bo ᾖ
che energy of many a backward race, while their mer-

chant navy probably supplied the wants of the great land
