284 NOTE'S. XXII. c. xxxvn. ξ 12—c.xxxv111. 59.

ἓ 12. dare dicare. A usual pleonasm in ceremonial
formulae like that in the next line.

Ρ 118 c. xxxvm. 52. quod nunquam. In earlier days the
soldiers had taken the oath of obedience (sacramentum) singly,
and had also pledged themselves voluntarily to their comrades
in the same decuria (of horse) or centuria (of foot) to be true
to each other. This pledge Mommsen believes to be a tra-
ditional custom of old Italy, and to be indicated in passages
of Livy ix. 39. 3, x. 38. 2 where milites sacrati are spoken of.
This was now made obligatory.

§3- iussu ...... abituros. These words are probably, as
Drakenborch suggests, a marginal comment on iure iurando,
{gagixthas slipped into the text. They seem needless in this

ad decuriandum. The MSS. have decuriatum and centuri-
atum, which are not known to occur elsewhere in this sense as
substantives. Some propose to omit the ad, and regard them
as supines‚ which would however be used in a passive sense.
In favour of the common reading it may be urged that Livy has
an especial fondness for verbals of the 4th decl. though centu-
riatus occurs only as the place of a centurio. There were
60 centurioe in the legion, and 30 deaut-ise of the horse attached
to it.

h ξ 4. ergo (ἔργῳ), archaic for eausa, occurs chiefly in legal
p rases.

ξ 6. arcessitum in It. This is probably a rhetorical use
of the charge which in early days of the struggles between the
two orders was so often urged by the tribunes against the
patrician rulers. Polybius ignores all these details of conflict of
opinion at Rome.

ξ 8. verior quam gratior. For this repetition of the com-
parative, cf. Cic. pro Milone, ‘non timeo ‘ne libentius haec in illum
evomere videar quam verius. On the other hand the second is
omitted where it seems most needed in 1. 25. 14, eo majore cum

gaudio, quo prope (for propius) metum res suerat. So Tac. Agr.
4, vehementius quam caute.

ἓ 9. quod ne. Valla proposedq uomodo for this reading of
the best MS. but qui would follow awkwardly and it seems
better to omit it. Cf. xia. 36. 3, miranti quoe res.

togatus. An acute suggestion of Muretus for locatus of
MSS. Cf. note on 23. 3 and 111. 10. 16, nisi dum in inte-oro res
sit, dum domi dum toqati sint, caveant.
