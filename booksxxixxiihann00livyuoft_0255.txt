river, as it flowed round a little island, offered a crossing-place
which was broader where the stream parted, and for that
reason shassowen‘

ostendere is used somewhat boldly with amnem as subject,
but the reasons specified serve to justify the tense.

S 5. mspam. This detail is peculiar to Livy, who in
other respects agrees closely with Polybius 111. 42.

mole. ‘Trouble.’ So for moral importanee, vr. 14. 1,

nmjor domi exorta moles coeyit acciri Romam dictatorem, vi.
19. 1, de imminenti mole libertatis. Cf. 22. 9.

coetns incubantes. ‘On their bucklers.’ Here as often
the Latin participle takes the place of the English preposition,
as manu tenens perducit, phalanqis subjectis admovent, which
Niigelsbach compares with it, p. 329.

5 6. mus, for reliquus. Cf. 1. 12. 10, alia Romana acies
audacia reyis accensa fundit Sabinos.

P. 29, ἓ ’7. tempori deesset. So occasioni, fortunae, liber-
tati, legi deesse, in the sense of ‘neglect,' 01· ‘fail in duty.'

· ξ 8. Iam. In Polyb. more definitely ‘on the 5th night.¹

naves. Madvig’s suggestion for the nantes of all MSS.
which was hard to translate; they answer to the λέμβοι, while
lintres corresponds to the μονόξυλα of Polyb. whose description
is here clear and definite; the fere implies that all the naves
were not appropriated to their use.

Navium agmen. ‘A line of vessels crossed higher up the
stream to break the force of the current, and seeured still
water for the punts which crossed below.’

transmittens is used intrans. as 20. 9.

§9- pars magna nantes. The close connexion of singu-
lar and plural for the same subject is an awkward constr. ad
syna-eim, though not unfrequent in Livy. Cf. 1v. 33. 7, Veiin-
tium mxima pars Tiberim effusi petunt.

c. xxvm. 5 2. nautarum multumque. The copula here is

often omitted in the MSS„ end some editors think that the
Ι hun-y of the scene is reflected in the phrase.

et qm...et qm. Referring to the two sets naut. mil.
