rat, alii rei causa in Africam misma est, which seem
to point to the recall of Hannibal to Africa after some
years of stay in Carthage, to which he had returned in
early life‚—a residence required to reconcile the ex-
pressions used by Livy, though he has neglected expli-
citly to state it. There are also verbal similarities
which point in the same direction‚ as in the passage of
Caelius preserved by A. Gellius (x. 24. 6), si vis milti
equitatum dare, et ipse cum cetero eaeercicu me sequi,

another which we find in Priscian 111. 607, dextimos

a likeness in Livy xx11. 50. 11. It is not unlikely
therefore that a writer in good repute like Oaelius,
whose style had more force and colour in it than the
bare and rugged annalists' of earlier days, should have
been freely used by Livy with little effort to hunt up
his authorities, or to compare the various sources

many authors, of unfolding the long rolls in which
their histories were written, and poring over their
archaic style, was sure to be distasteful to a man of
