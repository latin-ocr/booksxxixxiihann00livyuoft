infletum Metello credens. Livy xxxx. 18. Β, sacrileqas admovere
manue intactis illis thesauris. So inaccessus, incomptus, &c..
Niigelsbach 72. b.

c. ν. ς 1. satis ut. A somewhat grudging recognition of
the bravery of Flaminius.

ln re trepida. ¹ A state os panic.' Cf. 1. 27. 10, Tullus in re
trepida duodecim vovit Salios.

9 4. strepentium pav. This use of the gen. plur. of the
partio„ where ue should put abst] aet substantives‘ triumph
and paniol is of frequent occurrence in Livy. Cf. 17. 5,

flammasspirantummiraculo, xxm. 22. 7, fremitus indistzancium.

65 §8 6. lmngtkim capere is a frequent phrase in Livy. Of. 11.
vul.

Ρ 79, §7. per principes. In the old form of organizing
the legion the hastati formed the lst line, the principes the
2nd, as Livy describes at length, vm. 8. The or·de1 is heie
confused, as Livy is here writing probably fiom memory, uitli-
out documents, of a state of things which had passed away.

antesignani. Men of the fronlz line, whose siyna mani-
pulorum were carried. in the rear in battle, though in the van
when on the march. Thus Livy vm. 11. 4, struqcm et ante
siqua et post siytzasactam.

cohorte. This is an unusual expression. After the time
of Marius probably the old formation of the legion was super-
seded by that into 10 cohorts, but at this time the term was
only employed of the praetoria cohors, or body-guard. of the
general, and of the contingents of the allies. It is probably
used by Livy carelessly.

§8. motum terrae. The authority of Caelius is specially
referred to for this by Cicero, div. 1. 35, and it was probably
from him that Livy copied it.

e.v1.§2. Eum ev seems to require another sentence of
like form to follow, but the constr. suddenly changes.

roboravit. cf.xx1. 54. 3. ‘ss‘

53. noscitans. One of the frequentatives often used by
our author, though in this case seemingly less appropriate.

leg-lones. Livy commonly applies to other people the
distinctiva terme of the Roman civil and military systems.
For the facts of the war referred. to cf. Polyb. 11. 32, and note
un Livy xxx. 62. 2.
