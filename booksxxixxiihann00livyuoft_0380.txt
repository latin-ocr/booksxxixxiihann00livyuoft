312 APPENDIX I.

But in the description 01 1110 pass 115011, 111 1110 struggles with
the mountaineers, in the measurements of time, and in the
accounts of the dangerous point 01 the descent where the road
was swcpt away, there is often very close agreement in the
language of the two, though Livy adds a few details such as
those of the use 01 vinegar and fire to clear a passage through
the rocks. The incidents, however, which they have in com-
mon are just those which can most easily be localized 111 any
01 the rival routes, and they must be regarded as the least im-
portant evidence upon the subject. But in chapter 38, when
Livy has brought the Carthaginians to 1110 plains 01 Italy, he
pauses to notice the different opinions which were stated, and
to give his reasons 101 1110 route which he had traced. The
Poenine Alps, the great St Bel-nard, seems to have been com-
monly regarded as the pass of Hannibal, and stress was laid
on a 13150 derivation of the word, as 11 11 031110 110111 Poenus. It
was enough, 110 thought, to urge in answer that Germanic tribes
held the entrance to this pass, and there could have been no
motive to brave the stout resistance which they would probably
have offered. The earlier writer Caelius Antipater, whose work
on the Punic wars was largely used by Livy, brought the in-
vaders through ‘Cremonis Juzqumss a mountain unknown to
other authors, but which may remind us in its sound 01 the
Cramont, and at any rate closely corresponds to the Little
St Bernard, called the Graian Alps by Roman writers. But
this leads into the Italian Val d’Aosta, the upper part 01 which
was occupied by the Salassi, while the Gallie Libui held the
lower country. Tradition commonly, says Livy, knows nothing
01 111050 names in this connection, but makes Hannibal issue
from the mountains through the tribe 01 1110 Taurini, with
whom he first came into hostile contact. The Roman historian
admits that there was no sure evidence before him, and that he =
relies mainly on tradition3 the account 01 Polybius he did not
notice. But tradition in this matter was a guide of little
value. From the time when Scipio found himself too late
upon the Rhone, till he faced his enemy on the Ticinus, the
Roman government had entirely lost sight 01 the Carthagim'an
leader. The country through which he passed was quite un-
known to them, and no trustworthy information could be 101-
warded to Rome, or lodged 'm the official archives. The Gallie
mountaineers remained long unsubdued, and the eventful
tramp 01 many a later army effaced from their minds the
memory 01 1110 11131011 01 Hannibal. The popular legend 01
two centuries later was hardly likely to be accurate in such
details. It was known indeed that the Taurini were attaoked
before the colh'sion with the legions, and it was natural to sup-
pose that they denied him passage when he moved along their
vallcy, though Polybius tells us that he recruited first his
