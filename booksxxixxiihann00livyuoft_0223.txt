probably it may be traced to Philinus, who wrote in the Punic
interest. Here again Livy seems to have combined two dis-
tinct accounts, for 1118 latter part is purely Roman. It has
been thought that Sallust’s description ot Catiline suggested
some ot the language here used, but the resemblance is not
very close. The early part ot it is repeated by Livy nvn 41.
