prmtorian cohorte, Ep. ad Philipp. i. 13. praetorzpraeitor, ⁸ first
m rank‚’ is the oldest titlo of the chief magistrate of the republio.
Cf. Aseon. in Cio. Verr. ι. 14, veteres omnem mayistratum, cui
pareret exercitus, praetorem appellaverunt. Unde et praetorium
tabernaculum ejus ἀίείιιιν, et in castris porta praetoria, et hodt'e
quoque Proesectus Praetorio. The term is here extended to
Punic usage.

favor is said by Quintilian to have been thought a new
word by Cicero, savorem et urbanum Cicero nova credit, 11. 20.
10, though it was used by Lucretius, V1.47. It was first pro-
bably applied to applause in the theatre, and Cicero speaks
apologetically of his use of it. Or. pro Sestio 54, qui rumore
et, ut ipsi loquuntur, favore populi tenetur.

ξ 2. vixdum puberem. He was however about 23 years old,
for he was nine when his father went to Spain for nine years,
and he joined Hasdrubal after five of his eight years of rule
were over. cf. 2. 3 and 4. 10.

ad se accers. Yet 1. 4 implies that he went to Spain with
Hamilcar. Probably here, as elsewhere, Livy reproduces dis-
tinct traditions. Caelius Antipater, in a passage quoted by
Priscian, vm. 960, seems to refer to H., antequam Barca peri-
erat alii rei causa in Africam est missus. Yet Livy xxx. 37. 9
makes him say, novem annorum α vobis profectus post sextum
et tricesimum redii. In that case he would have had little
chance of learning statesinanship at home.

ξ 3. Hanno. Probably the chief rival of Hamilcar after
the lst war, the feud and reconciliation between whom were so
important in the struggle with the mercenaries. It was how-
ever, like other Punic names, a common one with leading men
at different periods.
