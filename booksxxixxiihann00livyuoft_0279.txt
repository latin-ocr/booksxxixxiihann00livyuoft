Ρ, 49 o. xm. § 1. ponte Ticinum. They had already
orossed the Po from Placentia, 39. 10, and were marching
along the left bank. The pons over the Ticinus, probably near
Pavia, was a fixed one, with a castellum or tc'te «ln pont, dis-
tinguished from the bridge of boats (rates) over the Po.

ἓ 3. sollicitari. Used absolutely 25. 2, without in deject.

Ictumulis. The text points to a place near the mouth of
the Ticinus, about the modern Carbonara, which agrees also
with the situation of the place of like name referred to 57. 9.
But Pliny, 32. 21. and Strabo, v. 1. 12, speak of the gold mines
of Victumulae or Ictumuli in the districtos Vercellae, and there
are still traces of them near Biella to the north of Veroellae,
while there were none near the mouth of the Ticinus. In
later times the Romans found a pretext for a war with the
Salassi, and despoiled them of the mines in question, and it
is probable that the contractors who farmed them afterwards
and employed some 5000 workmen in them brought the
produce to Ictumuh', which served as the chief emporium for
the whole neighbourhood until the colony of Eporedia was
plantedinthe centre of the mining district. C. I. L. v. 2, p. 715.

5 4. pronuntiat, ¹ offers‚’ like proponit below ; so declarare
munera, indicere praemia.

in quorum spem. The use of the prepos. is singular,
as spes is not the object, but the cause of the action, which is
however consounded with it. Heerwagen compares v, 30. 4,
velbent in eam spem liberos tollere.

§ 5. immunem, i.e. free of all payments to the state.

ἓ 6. potestatem fact. H. here claims a power which
οΒΪοῗΥιὲἒοξῗςιὲοι-εὼ at times exereised, of bestowing the civitas

ἓ 7. mancipium, the ‘taking by the hand‚' was a symbol
of purchase, and thus the term was used alike for the right
of ownership (eg. vitaque mancipio nulli datur), as also for the
slave as the property of his master.

§8- silicem retinens. The knife of flint was used for
sacrificial purposes till late in the days of the Empire, as we

see from the Acta fratrum Arvalium. It was probably a '

custom of immemorial antiquity, retained from the ages which
had little use of metals‚ by a religious conservatism which
§eared to change its forms, cf. the proverb inter sacrum saxum-
que, Plaut. Capt. 111. 4, like our ‘ between hammer and anvil.’

falleret, ‘ forswear himself.’ Cf. Hor. Carm. 11. 8. 10, εω-
pedit matris cineres opertos Ι fallere.
