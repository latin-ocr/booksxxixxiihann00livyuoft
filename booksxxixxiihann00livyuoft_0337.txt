NOTES. XXII. c. xxw. §ll—c. xxv. §3- 269

5 11. Iusta acle ac 0011. sig. Common expressions for a
regular engagement, as distinet from skirmishes.

§12 Bovianum was the chief town of the Samnites
Pentri, α. 31. 4, so important in early times that the Romans
made repeated attempts to secure it as a step towards the
conquest οἰ Samnium.

iussu dict. The details of the levies had been left to the
discretion of the dictator. The regular dilectus was resorted
to for the legions. The socii were required to furnish contin-
gents of a certain strength under their native officers, over
whom Roman proefecti were commonly appointed.

quingentos. The MSS. have et equites adducentem without
a numeral. This may have grou 11 out of equites D ducentem.
Alschefski read mille, supposing that et was a mistake for the
sign oo.

514. vanam, though not in the MSS„ seems needed to
explain the vanioribus which follows. For this use of the
word Heerwagen compares Verg. AEn. 11. 79, Nec si miserum
Fortuna Simonem Ι finxit, vanum etiam mendacemque improba

- finget.

e. xxv. ξ 1. contione. Referring to the speech of the
tribune below.

52. ut. ‘Assuming that.'

ἓ 3. trib. plebis. The tribunes of an earlier age had been
the spokesmen and leaders of the plebs in its civil struggles
with the privileged order of the patres, and in their spaeches,
as reported in the annalists, it was a common topic of eom-
plaint that their rulers engaged in constant wars to distract
the attention of the people from their grievances at home.
The legal inequalities had been long swept away, but the
tribunate lasted on, though it had lost its original value and
importance. The tribunes still headed the opposition against
the senatoriam government, which they rudely shook in the
period of the Gracchi, and helped in a later age to overthrow.
It is a feature of Livy's rhetorical style to introduce their

har-angues into his text. The same names and argument recur
in different periods.

enlmvero. The MSS. have only enim, which is used in
other places of Livy, as vn. 32.13,e11ipti0a11y‚t0 reply to sup-
posed obiectione, but not, according to Madvig, to express in-
dignation, as enimvero is employed Cic Verr. 1. 26, Hic tum
alius ex azia parte: enimvero ferendum hoc non est.
