per, ‘on occasion of) cf. 11. 34. 1. per secessionem plebis.

seditionem, derived from sed ‘apart‘ (cf. sed fraude archaic
for sine fraude) and ire, cf. seduco, sepono.

monnio ante. Manlius was in Cisalpine Gaul as praetor the
year before, xxx. 17. 7 ; an inclusive reckoning is here adopted.
Of the circumstances oi the voxv we know nothing.

locatam, ‘put out to contract‚’ the duty commonly of the
ἓξὲξ-ᾆξαι occasionally of commissionem, as here, specially

ξ 9. ln eam diem...the time sor the elections often varied
with the return oi the consuls from the seat of war, and no
fixed rules could be adopted, though dictatore were sometimes
specially named to carry on the eleotions.

ξ 11. rectius visum. The appointment of an ‘interrex’
was a constitutione] expedient in the case of the death or
resignation of the supreme magistrate. The dictator was
regarded as a colleague specially named on urgent occasions
by a living consul.

ξ 12. vitio creatis. The vitium might consist in the
neglect of the iormalities of the auspices (cf. inauspicato xxr.
63. 7), or in some unfavourable sign at the time or after the
ceremony. It rested with the college oi augurs to decide by a
formal decretum, that the election was so vitiated, upon or
without an appeal to them by the senate or magistrate. The
election was not thereby made null and void, but the officer
was expected to abdicate oi himself, and might at the end of
his term be impeached for his irreverenee if he persisted in
retaining his office. Vitio sacti abdicarunt is the regular entry
111 such cases in the Capitoline Fasti. The usage gave a dan-
ger ous encouragement to party intrigues.

ad interi-ega. res. i.e. the term of the consuls' office
apii-ed, and they could not therefore name another dictator.

c. xxxxv. ἓ 1. a patribus. The traditions and the name of the
interreges point to the kingly period of Rome, and the vacancy at
the death of the elective monarch, when there was no successor to
step at once into his place. Then, says Livy 1. 17. 4‚the senate
divided itself into ten decuriae, in each oi which the lot decided
the order of rank. A board consisting of one of each decuria
then held the monarchy in commission for 50 days, each in
turn bearing the insignia of supreme command for 5. Then
a second board came into office, and so on till a new king was
elected. The decuria was supposed to consist of 10, as the
early senate first contained 100. ln the days of the Republic
