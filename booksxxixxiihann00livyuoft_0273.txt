sense οἱ arresting the movement.

56. quae pars. Fabri gives other examples of the fre-
quent use of quis or qui for uter.

Ρ 42, 5 8. eo ipso, quod.. This is an afterthought of
history. Livy forgets that H. had no great name as yet, and
that the consuls were not specially elected for military skill,

5 9. mter se ommonem, ‘their estimato of each other,’ as
inter se is often used for reciprocal action, as also alii alios, dcc.
Sallust combines both. Cat. 22. 2, quo inter se magis fidi
forent alius alii tanti facinoris conscii. Later writers, like
Tacitus, use invicem.

quod, renatus ln calna. Polyb. , 111. 60, says πρότερον ὀλίγαις
ἡμέραις, and makes Hannibal marvel at the promptitude of
Scipio, though at least a month must have elapsed, and the
Roman forces might have been brought round to meet H. at
the foot of the Alps before he had recruited his strength. It is

the Scipionic circle in giving a favourable colom* to what was
really questionable generalsln'p.

· 510. occupavit, ‘took the initiative by.’ Cf. 1. 14. 6,
οεσιφαὺαηε bellum facere; Hor. Carm. 1. 14. 2, interdum rapere

comessionem. ‘I regarded as a victory the admission of
(inferiority) implied' m the enemy 's flight and refusal to engage:
This 1s,of course, a mere rhetorical boast.

5 3. meis ausplcfls. In the technical system of Rome the
auspicia were taken by the legati or deputy commanders in the
name of the general in chief. Cf. Tac. Ann. 1. 41, ductu Ger-
manici auspiciis Tiberii. Menum. Ancyr. res aut a me aut per
legatos meis auspiciis gestas. Horace says, Carm. 1. ’7. 27, with
less propr-icty, Teucro duce et auspice Teucro.
