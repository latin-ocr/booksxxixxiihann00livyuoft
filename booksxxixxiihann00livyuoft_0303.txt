serendo, ut sors α serendo, mons ab eminemlo,sons α findendo,
pons apetendo. Hence the portent unam excidisse, xxu. 1. 11.
As to the shrinking, cf. the story iu Pliny, 34. 38, of the
‘lucky' farthing in the family of the Servilii, which grew
larger and smaller to portend good and ill luck. Cr. also the
story in Herodotus vni. 137 of the portentous loaves of the
young Perdiccas which used to grow to double the natural

size.

ἓ 6. decemviri, i. e. sacrissaciumlis. These since 367 13.c.
had taken the place of the uviri who had special charge of tho
libri Sibyllini. In later days these books were under the care
of the xvvz'ri. Cf. Hor. Carm. Saec. 69, quindecim Diana preces
virorum! curat. Vergil makes AEneas promise the Cumaean
Sibyl to have her oracles thus cai-ed for¹ AEn. VI. 72, Hic eqo
namque tuas sortes arcanaque sata} dicta 7116oe qemi ponam,
lectosque sacrabo l alma viros.

§7. qulbus edltum est. ‘ To whom they were enioined
(by the sacred books) to offer them.' Edere is the usual term
for such oraculas warnings.

5 8. pondo. The old abl. was added to the amount speei-
fied as lg'bra pondo, uncia pondo, a pound or ounce by weight,
and afterwards used absolutely as here, the libris being omitted.
By a further license auri pondo becomes a nomin. for ‘ a. quan-
tity of gold.’ Cf. xxw. 14. 8, αιινι· pondo duo millt'a septuayinta

fuit.

Iunoni in Avent. The temple of J uno Regina of Veii was
dedicated by Camillus, v. 22. When her t. was struck with
lightning the matrons, as here, made a collection to present
an offering, and virgins sang a processional hymn. xxvu.

ς 9. lectisternium iuventuti. The common reading is
Iuventati, ‘ for the genius of youth,' but as Madvig points out
the words deinde universo pop. imply that some charge on a
special order has been already mentioned. Yet he doubtfully
accepts the change, as a lectisternium was a priestly ceremony,
though xxn. 1. 20 senatores straverunt. Lectisternia were first.
introduced 13.c. 399, cf. Servius ad Verg. G. 111. 533, pulvinaria
pro templis ponimus, cum sint proprie lectuli, qui sterni in
templis consuerunt. Hor. Carm. 1. 37. 2, nunc Saliaribus Ι or-
nare pulvinar deorum Ι tempus erat dapibus, Sodales.
