ἓ 5. quod ini iustum imperium. This probably refers
especially to the neglect of Flaminius to apply in person for
the lex curiata, commonly called de imperio, by which the
people as represented hy the curies or their lictors, bound *
themselves to obey the already elected magistrate. It was
something like the oath of obedience (sacramentum) which the
soldiers took to their general, or the form of ‘doing
homage ’ in later days. It confer-red no new powers, but was
thought constitutionally necessary, especially for military
duties, holding the Comitia Centuriam, or for judicial func-
tions. Cic. de leg. agr. 11. 12. 30, consuli, si leyem curiatam
non habet, attinqere rem militarem non licet. It does not seem
as if any other than the head of the executive concerned
could bring forward the lex curiata, though in that ease
Camillus must have dispensed with it when Rome was oc-
cupied by the Gauls‚ like Flaminius in the present case. In
later days it seems to have been argued that a law of Sulla
allowed the consuls to dispense with the formality in certain
cases, Cic. ad fam. 1. 9. 25, leyem curiatam consuli feni opus
