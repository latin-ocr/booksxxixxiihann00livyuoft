228 NOTES. XXI. 0. 11111. §2—0. Lvn. 53.

qua Gallicis is a correction of Madvig sor quoe G. of the
MSS. The centro was formed of all the infanny, not of Gauls
and Africans alone.

Ρ, 62, ξ 3. Placentiam recto it. Livy and Polyb. both
mention the retreat of this body to P. without adding that
they crossed over a bridge. 11⁶ we hold to the view that the
battle was fought on the west of the Trebia, we must assume
that they erossed by a permanent bridge held by the garrison
of P„ 01· in boats which they may have found, as in ξ 8.

§5. audaciam ingr. Perhaps to balance the cunctatio
inm-odiendi just above. In itself it is an unusual expression,
audacia being commonly used by itself.

ξ 8. sauciorum is added to make sense of the passage
which is very harsh without some such epithet, even if magna
ex parte be taken, as Fabri suggests, with trajicerent. Beside
m. ex parte Livy uses maxima parte, mayna parte, and partem
nmquam much in the same sense of ‘ mainly.’

ratibus Τ. This seems decisivo as to Livy’s view that the
battle was fought on the Eastern bank, while the camp was
011 the W. of the Trebia, improbable as it is on all accounts.
Polyb. has no corresponding ssage, and Livy’s authority in
matters of geography is very 5111λέ111.

0. Lvn. ξ 1. urbem Romanam. Heerwagen notes that
L. uses this expression at times with a certain rhetorical
emphasis, ef. 111. 7. 1.

§2- alterum. This is a correction of Madvig for the
altero...7·c¹i·oca.to of the MSS„ which mars the antithesis, and
involves an awkward series of phrases,

quas alias leg. There were many legions yet to be called
out, as subsequent events proved. Polyb. instead of such ex-
aggeratione speaks of the roinforeements sent to Sicily and
elsewhere, and remarks that the Romans were most formidable

. in times of crisis, 111. 75.

ἓ 3. ingenti periculo. A very unnecessary exposure‚ as a
dictator or interrex might have conducted the elections.
Polyb. says that Sempr. concealed his losses in the despatches
to Rome, and does not mention the Journey. As he passed

through Rome on his way to Trebia (Polyb. 111. 68) 110 might
easily have held the elections there.

P. 63. fallendi. ‘Of escaping notice,' cf for this absolute
use 48. 5. xxn. 33. 1.
