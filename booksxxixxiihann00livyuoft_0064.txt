of the early Empire show this spelling 3 but nouus
of the second decl. in ius, ium were written in the
Republic with one i only in the qen. as imperi,· adjec-
tives assumed the double i earlier, and gradually a
like rule spread to the noune.

K. C. Originally the letter O corresponded to our
G sound, as in the C which stands for Gaius, till
Spurius Carvilius introduced the letter Gr, and C
then took the place of the tenuis K.

CI, TI, were often confused in common speech,
inscriptions, and MSS„ but in the following words
the right reading seems quite established: condicio,
contio, convitium, dicio, iwdutiae, mentius, otium, setius,
solacium, suspitio (Fleckeisen, Fccnfziy Art).

QVO. GV. QVV. The old form quom became
cum in the time of J. Caesar, there being little
evidence for quum in the first century. So quoi
passed into cui and quare into cur. Secundus is
early found for sequondus. AEquom became oec‘uan,
then later on aequum.

N in old Latin was often omitted before i and
s, as in cojunae, cosol, cesor, Meqalesia,· but in the
final ens of the numerals it was retained till the
end of the Augustan era, though afterwards confined
to totiens, quotiens, and the like.

SS, frequent at the end of the Republic, was
changed to s 3 thus Cicero used caussa, divissiones, but
later inscriptions after the Monumentum Ancyranum
have a single s.
