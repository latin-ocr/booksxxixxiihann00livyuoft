Patres conscripti. The writers generally thought that this
phrase denoted the original senators of patrician origin, and
the later enrolled of plebeian rank, thus Livy 11. 1. 7,
[Brutus] patrum numerum primoribus equestris gradus electis
ad trecentorum summum explevit: traditumque inde fertur,
ui in senatum vocarentur qui patres quique conscripti essent.
Servius ad AEn. 1. 426 ascribes them to an earlier change,
conscriptos qui post a Servio Tullio c plebe electi sunt. But
it is unlikely that the plebs was admitted in such early times
to the ruling council, and conscribere is simply to enroI, as in
the expressions conscribere emercitum, tribum, collegia. It
is probable that patres conscripti meant only ‘ Those put upon
the roll of the Senate,' and so ‘ Members of the Senate.' Cf.

Willems Senat. p. 39.

3934& ἐ 7. a Gallis auro, i. e. after the capture of Rome
sc. ⁴ .

patres vestros, i. e. the fathers of the senators before whom
the speech was delivered. It was however more than 60
years since the battle with Pyrrhus near Heraclea. The
senate, though filled with ex-offioials, was practically confined
to the ruling families of Rome.

ἀ ξ 8. nec supersumus nisi. ‘ And only those of us survive,’
c.

ξ 9. ne in acie q. fuerunt. This is Madvig’s correction of
the rcfuyerunt of the MSS. which had been long noticed as
suspicious in connection with in acic. Perizonius suggested
er acie. W. objects to fuerunt that Polybius represents all
the prisoners as the garrison left in the camp, but 'this does
not seem very forcible.

5210. extulisse. The use of the infin. perfect with velle
is of frequent occurrence, when the result rather than the
progress of the action is to be expressed. The old laws com-
monly have it in prohibitions, as Ne Baccanal habuisse velit,
so Horace, Sat. 11. 3. 187, ne quis humasse velit Aiacem Atride
vetas cur. Of. 1. 2. 28, sunt qui nolint tetiyisse. Zumpt, 590.

gloriati sint. As the subj. of the future perfect, this word
like extulisse expresses the action in a livelier form as a com-
pleted result. Cf. xxx. 14. 5, ηυῑῑα...υιῖι·τ,ἰιτῑι7η...εετ qua eqo
(eque ac tenfflerantia...yloriatas fuerim.
