country, making husbaudry and irrigation riiatters
of scientific study, so that even the Roman senate
in a later age thought her books on agriculture
worthy of translation. Abroad, she guided the streams
of trade to every quarter, now opening up relations
with the heart of Africa by means of caravans, now
turning to account in Spain the old Phoem'cian skill
in mining, now with dai-ing enterprise exploring
regions hitherto unknown.

Of two such atteinpts especially we have some-
detailed accounts One called the Periplus of Hanno
was a long coasting voyage along the South-West of
Africa to about the Sth degree of latitude, conducted
by the order of the State with a fleet of 60 vessels,
On, his return the admira] drew up a report
officially‚ which was consigned to the archives in
the temple of Baal, and part of it is still extant in
a Greek translation. We may still perhaps distin-
guish in his narrative the crocodiles of Senegal, the
sweet-scented forests of Cape Verde, the lofty moun-
tains of Sierra Leone, and the fantastic forms of the
Gor-illas, so called from a faulty reading of a passage
in the Periplus. The second enterprise under Himilco
was directed along the coast of Portugal and Gaul,
and thence across to the Cassiterides or Scilly Isles, at ¹
which Phoenician adventure in olden times had stopped
in its quest for tin, but from which the Cartha-

ginians pushed on to the neighbouring shores of
Cornwall and of Ireland.
