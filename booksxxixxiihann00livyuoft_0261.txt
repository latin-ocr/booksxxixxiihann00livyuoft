agreeing in much of the description, especially in the details
which admit of rhetorical treatment, yet widely diverge in
local data The former traces the route almost certainly over
the little St Bernard, the latter probably over Mont Genevre.
Ammianus Marcellinus xv. 10 closely follows Livy, as also does
Silius Italicus in the lines 111. 466:

Jamque Tricastinis intetzditfinibus aymen,
Jam faciles campos, jam rura Vocontia carpit,-
Turbidus hic truncis saxisque Druentia lectum
Ductoris vastavit iter.

Cf. sse Appendix ⁸ on the Boute of Hannibal)

recta reg-ione. ‘In direct course) Cf. Lucr. 11. 249, and
Cic. Verr. v. 176, si quis tantulum de recta reqione deflexerit.

ad laevam. These words have given much trouble to the
interpreters. They have been explained as ‘the left hand of
Livy sitting in his study,' or ‘the left oi an army in retreat,
which would be equivalent to the ordinary right,’ or ‘the left
bank of the Isere‚’ or they have been regarded as a mistake for
the right hand. They seem to imply Livy‘s belief that after the
proceedings in the island, H. marched down the stream a little
way, hearing possibly of Scipio's withdrawal, and then turned
off to what was later Augusta Tricastinorum (Aoste).

“ Vocontiorum. They are localized by Strabo, 1v. 6. 4, in the
mountain woodland between the Allobroges and Salyes. The
Tricorii are placed by Strabo to the east of the Vocontii, or
between the Drac and the Durance.

haud usquam impedita. A most unfitting description for
the tangled country between the Isere and the Durance.

Druentia. Attempts have been made to identify this with
the Arve, the Dranse, or the Drac. It is of course the Druen-
tius of Strabo who calls it ποταμός χαραδρώδης, the modern
Durance. It is true that it would have been out of the
natural course from the Insula, nor would H. in that case
have come across the Allobroges. Also Livy's description may
suit the lower, but not the upper stream along which the
army must have travelled, if at all. He probably took it
from some topographer's account, and Lavallee calls it ‘la
riviere la plus desordonnee de la Franee‚’ Geogr. Phys. 186.

ἓ 11. vada...gurg1tes. These acc. may depend on proebet,
but more probably on volvens, which by zeugma is used in a
somewhat different sense with them and with saza.

glareosa. is an awkward epithet for saxa, unless we take it
to mean that the bed was full ot rocks and gravel mixed.
