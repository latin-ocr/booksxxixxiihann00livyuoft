ROUTE OF HANNIBAL. 309

ἁπλῆν ῥύσιν. It is moreover above the junction with the
Durance, to crosa over which would have been a needless
labour for the army.

The other place suggested near Beaucaire and Tarascon is
quite inconsistent with these data. In Livy there are no
definite statements on the subject to point to any special
place. After the passage of the Rhone however he says that
Hannibal pushed on inland to avoid all contact with the Roman
army, but his route was probably decided on beforehand,·and
he was guided by the Gauls, who had invited him to Italy,
aud who would naturally lead him through the passes which
would bring him with most ease into their cantons.

Onward to the Isere his route is certain, after that all is
matter of debate.

Oui· two authorities give a like account of the island enclosed
between the Rhone and the Isere—the insula Allobroyum of
later days—and oi the contests between the native powers, in
which Hannibal took part. In Polybius we find besides the
following data: (l) ‘Hannibal having in ten days marched
800 stadia along the river, began the asccnt of the Alps.’ (2)
’ We hear that the chieftain with whom he sided in the quan-el
joined him in his march, and that the barbarians were kept in
check in the plain country alike from tear of the cavalry, and
of the native aid.

The words ‘along the river,' παρὰ τὸν ποταμόν, are not in
themselves definite. They have been taken to refer to the
Isere which was spoken of not long before, and most critics
accordingly trace the route of Hannibal along one or other of
its banks. But there can be little doubt that the ‘river' of
the whole narrative is the Rhone, and in chapter 39 Polybius
expressly says that they kept near it to the entrance of the
mountain pass. Of course it is not to be supposed that it was
tracked in all its windings, in the great bend for example
which it makes at Lyons, but only that the general movement
was in the direction of its stream. The country through which
the march would lie was such that the cavalry could be used
to good effect, while the left bank of the Isere would not at all
meet this condition, and the right one would only partially
fulfil it. In both cases the mountain country comes in sight
too soon, and the ascent (ἀναβολή) must have begun long be-
fore they had traversed 800 stadia of road, or made their ten
days' leisurely advance, in constant tear of an attack.

Both these conditions are complied with by the route, which
following the Rhone up to Vienne, leaves it for a while in its
great bend, and meets it once more at St Genix, and thence to
the pass of Mont du Chat where the ascent may be taken to
begin. That point once reached the way would naturally lead
along the upper course of the here, through the Tarantaise,
