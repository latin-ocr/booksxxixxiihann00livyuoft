degresso (Hannibali), cf. 1. 8. 4, locus qui nunc sceptus de-
scendentibus inter duos lucos est.

ς 6. 1d quum, διο. This is diffloult, for Polyb. usserts that
Η. descended among the Insubres, as indeed it was likely that
he would (lo, since they and their allies had invitod him to
cross into Italy. It may be that Livy only meant that the
annalists all spoke of his attack on the Taurini as his first
movement in Italy, and as the Taurini were, strictly speak-
ing, a Ligurian not a Gallic tribe (Strabo 1v. 6), possibly the
passage, whose reading is so doubtful, brought out the close
neighbourhood of the hostile Τ. to the friendly Insubres.

ambigi, quanam. No official account was likely to reach
Rome from the time when H. disappeared from Scipio’s sight,
till he was heard of near the Po. The Alps were till long
after a terra incoynita. and few like Polybius cared to travel
so far to gather up the local traditione

P. 41, credere, the transition from the passive ambiyi to
an active is marked, but not unusual in Livy. In orat. directa
he would naturally say vulyo credunt (sc. homines).

Poenino. This was the pass of the Great St Bernard. Its
name is thought to be derived from the Celtic deity Penn
(Zeuss‚ die Deutschen‚ p. 5). Jupiter Poem'nus was worshipped
on the summit, and the name has been found on''30⁷ ex voto
tablets which have been discovered near the top. It was also
called Mons Jovis, which survive-s in the names Mont-Joux‚
Plan-de-Joux which are still localized on the height. It was
by this pass that Livy, v. 35, brought the Boii and Lingones
into Italy in the 5th century ac. The fanciful derivation of
the name referred to in the text was an argument likely to
be urged in early times.

Cremonis lug. It is tempting to identify this with the
Crament, between la Thujle and Eutreves, beside the little
St Bernard, but the attempt rests on grounds of etymology as
insecure as the case just speeified. It is probable that only
one route was then known across the Alpes Graiae, that of
which Strabo speaks, IV. 67, ‘the road from the Salassi parts
into two branches, the one rough and inaccessible for beasts of
'gurdon ove'r the Poeninus, the other more westerly through ther

entrones.

57. per alios. Madvig’s conjecture for per saltus mont.
which is obviously corrupt. Lipsius and others whom W.
follows read per Salassos, which is inviting‚ but the addition
of montanos would be needless, as Madvig points out. The
