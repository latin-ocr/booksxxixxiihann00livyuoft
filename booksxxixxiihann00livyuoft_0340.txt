272 NOTES. XXII. c. xxvl. §2—0. xxvn. §3-

proclamando. A contemptuous term instead of orando.
Of. Cic. de Orat. 1. 46, non enim causidicum nescio quem neque
proclamatorem aut rabulam hoc sermone nostro conquirimus.

in notitiam...honores. ‘Attained to notoriety, and then to
public office.’ These honours were the lower offices afterwards
included in the comprehensive term viqintiviratus, comprising
several boards, the lowest rank 111 a political career.

ξ 3. duabus aedjl. Only three cases are known of men
who held both oedileships‚ but one or other was a necessary
step in an official career, and was heavily weighted with the
expenses of the public shows,

ξ 4. dictatoria invidia. For this use of an adjective,
to express the object of the substantive, cf. Cio. cluent. 28. 77,
(κε invidia senatoria crescere, Liv. 111. 42. 6, posito decemvirali
odio, xxm. 18. 10, divino hzmzanoqae scelere liberari.

sciti plebis. Commonly in the order plebeiscitum. Cf.
Festus, p. 293, scita plebei appellamur ca quoe plebs suo suffra-
gyio sine patribus jussit, plebeio mayistratu royante. Cf. 25. 17.

L. §5. aequi atque in. ‘Friends and foes‚’ as elsewhere in
ΝΥ·

P.106‚§ 7 aequato imp. Polyb says δύο Δικτάτορες
ἐγεγόνεισαι, ὃ πρότερον οὐδέποτε συνεβεβήκει, 111. 103. Thai:
there was no constitutional impossibility in this is shown by
the appointment of M. J unia Pera and M. Fabius Puteo at the
same time, and though the latter is made to say neque duos
dictatores tempore uno, quod nunquam antea factum esset, pro-
bare se, Liv. xxnr. 23. 2, yet he accepted office notwithstanding.
The fasti do not recognize Minucius as dictator, but an in-
scription gives him the title, O. I. L. 1. 556. Such aroyatio as

that dle aequando imperio is quite unknown to constitutional
proce ure.

c. xxvn. ξ 3. maiorem minori. In technical language the
manistram-3 maiores were those who had the imperium, together
with the censors, while all the rest were minorem but the
terms are often used relatively, thus the dictator had a maior
potestas as compared with all other officers, and the consul re-
latively to the praetor.

virgas ac secures...tremere. Referring probably to the like
case of Q. Fabius, who as mayister equitum disobeyed the
instructions of the dictator Papirius Cursor, and though he
gained a victory, nearly suffered for his want of discipline,
n. c, 322. Cf. Livy vm. 32. 6, tlt-nc Papirius redinteyrata ira
spoliari magyistrum equitum ac viryas et secures expediri iussit.
