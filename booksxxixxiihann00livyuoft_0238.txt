ᾗ 4. nullum ante finem. The long delay and heavy losses
of the siege may well have disgusted Hannibal with operations
which gave so little scope for his genius for strategy. We find
therefore that in Italy he rarely persevered in the siege of any
of the fortresses by which he passed in his campaigns. He
marched too rapidly through hostile country to carry with him
the heavy materials of a siege train.

P, 16, c. xv. ξ 2. supellectilem. We may explain supeltec-
as a contracted form of superlectus, though we read Labeo ait
originem fuisse supellectilis quod olim his qui in legionibus
proficiscerentur locari solerent qnoe sub pellibus usui forent.

§a octavo mense. Rome had therefore ample time to
send the needful succour to Saguntum, and by her long delay
she not only deserted an ally, but brought invasion upon Italy.

octavo...quam. The post is here omitted before quam, as
in 1v. 47. 5, die octavo quam creatus erat, and other places,

coeptum. Note the omission of sit after this word, and of
esse after captum.

quidam scripsere, as Polyb. 111. 17.

ξ 4. fieri non p. The chronological difficulty existed only
in the authorities which Livy followed. The account of Poly-
bius is clear and consistent, agreeing only with L. in the eight
months for the siege, and the five for the march to Italy. He
makes the Roman envoys reach H. at Carthago Nova before
the siege begins, and throws back the embassy of Saguntum to
the year before the consulship of Scipio and Sempronius.

ἓ 5. coeptum. Weissenborn remarks that Livy forgets
that the consuls entered office on the l5th of March, and that

ξ 6. excessisse. ‘ The battle on the T. cannot have fallen
so late.' As for the phrase Fabri compares xxx. 26. 1, inse-

creatus a. Τ. S. The magistrate presiding at the electioris
must be of like or higher rank, i. e. dictator, consul, or inter-
rex. He was said creare, that is, to declaro the candidate
elected, though the phrase populus creat is also used.
