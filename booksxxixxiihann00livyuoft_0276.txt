si vinculis. ‘On condition of being set free from 1115
bonds, and receiving if victorious, &cst

ξ 2. deiecta in 1d, ‘thrown for that purpose‚’ i. e. into the
helmet or urn, so conjicere sortem in urnam, sitellam, or

cistulam.

ξ 3. et, ut cuiusque. The MSS. have no ut, but it seems to
be required, and may have been omitted after the et, from the
similarity of the words. W. notes that only one pair of com-
batants is mentioned by Polyb„ and thinks that therefore the
et cujus of some MSS. is better, but the vincentium of the last
line points to several pairs fighting together.

exciderat. So ὁ κλῆρος ἐκπίπτει. Cf. xxm. 3. 7, nominibus
in urnam conjectis citari, quod primum sorte nomen excidit,

is unchanged in composition, but as 111 trifolium, triclinium,
trianum, from the threesold beat. The word is also used os
the ceremonial dances of the Romans, as of the Salii, cum
tripudiis solemnique cantu, 1. 20. 3, and of the Fratres Arvales
in the inscriptions.

ἓ 4. is habitus animorum. Cf. 2. 6, eo suit habitu oric.

§4- habentes. The MSS. have habentibus, andW. retains
it, but it seems equally awkward to regal-d it with Fabri as an
abl. abs„ or as dative agreeing with vobis while understanding
‘sugam’ with claudunt as W. suggests.

§6. possident. ‘The port’ which corresponds to πρότι,
