mgunbus. They had been several centuries before en.
listed in the armies of Carthage, Herod. 1. 165, and joined H.
in force on his arrival in Cisalpine Gaul. The Roman writers
speak of them as hardy peasants assueti malo, cf. Vergil AEn.
xx. 700, and they held out stoutly long after the rest of Italy
had been subdued.

quingentis, like the quinquaqinta in the next section, is
supplied from the parallel account of Polybius.

g 3. Libyphoenices. The Phoenician settlers who had
many centuries before settled in the interior of Africa, were
supposed to have come through Sidon, and to be agricultural
tribes dispossessed perhaps by J oshua from Palestine. As such
they betook themselves not to trade but husbandry in their new
homes, and by their mixture with the nativos gave rise to a
new race, whose name implies this fusion, like the Celtiberi,

Ilergetum ex Hisp. This seemed suspicions to Schweig-
haeuser, who noted (ap. Polyb. 111. 33) that they are the only
force here ascribed to Spain, which must have furnished a
larger contingent, and that there is no such addition as ex
Hispania in the corre‘sponding passage of Polyb„ where the
MSS. have Λεργετῶν. He believed therefore that in both
texts the name of some unknown African tribe must have been
changed by mistake for that of a known Spanish one.

§4. qua parte belli. A phrase used by Livy (cf. 17. 8)
for qua parte copiarum of 41. 4 and 53. 1. Contrast the petty
naval forces here specified with the immense fleets which
fought in the lst war. There is an ellipse of tantam before
trimma, somewhat as in ita producto, 5. 9.

aptae remigio. Of. coelum stellis aptum, Verg. AEn. 1v. 482.

Ρ, 24, ἓ 5. Onusam. A very uncertain reading taken from
xxn. 20. 4. The MSS. have 0m1'ssa. Gronovius proposed to

read Etovissa, which Ptolemy 11. 6 mentions as an inland city
of the Edetani.
