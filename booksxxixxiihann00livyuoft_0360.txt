ἓ 6. subsidia, i. e. not ‘the reserves ' in the ordinary sense,
as they constituted the main line, though they were kept back
for a time, ἐφεδρείας τάξιν, Pol.

Hasdrubal was in command on the left wing, and Livy has
not explicitly stated anythjng about him since the Roman
cavalry was routed. Polybius says that he galloped to support
the Numidians on the right, and sent them to pursue the
allied cavalry, who gave way at his approach, while he himself
charged the Romans in the centre. Livy has omitted some
details, or they have dropped out of his text.

ea parte praeerat probably means that Hasdrubal, as the
highest in command, gave general orders to the whole eavahy
ἕξᾷῖἰὲξ arrived on the right wing. This is implied in

subductos ex media acie N. They were posted on the right,
but may have wheeled round on the centre, when the cavalry
of the allies retired before the charge os Hasdrubal. But the
words are awkward and there may be some disturbance of the
text. On the whole we must own that if Livy wrote this
chapter as we find it, he had no clear idea of the battle or
failed to convey it to his readers. Polybius is entirely ex-
plicit.
