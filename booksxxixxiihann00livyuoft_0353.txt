NOTES. XX11. c. xxxvm. ξ ll—c. xxxlx. 3'9. 22:55

P, 119, ἕ 11. res...h0m1nibus.... Cf. Hor. Ep. 1. 1. 19, Et
mihim. non me rebus subjunyere conor.

5 12. id locorum. In a temporal sense. Cf. rx. 45. 1, nunc
quando vana verba ad id locorum fuerint, rebus standum esse.

513. Et sua... Fabri and W. retain the id oi the MSS.
instead of the correction of Gronovius.

1d...persevera.ret. A less usual construction than with in
and the abl. but used by cicero, Quint. 24, neque te ipsum icl,
quod suscepisses, perseverare.

c. mni. §2- indicente. A correction of Gronovius for
the indigentes of MSS., like the ‘non me indicente haec sium
Terence Adelph. 111. 4. 62, and Cio. de fin. 11. 3 indicente tc
of some MSS. Though the act. part. is not found elsewhere
in Livy, the passive indictus is less rare. Cf. v. 15. 6.

§3. claudente. This is supported by the use of Sal-
lust, Hist. 111. 25, neque enim iynormztia claudit res, and
possibly of Cic. Tusc. v. 8, etiamsi ez aliqua parte clauderet,
though the form oi the word has been objected to by Bentley

' and other critics, as claudicare is more usual. The MS. read-

ings vary.

idem...1m·1s. Varro as consul had equal right and autho-
rity with his colleague. Ι

ξ 5. cum fflo. Madvig returns to the older reading of
the verbs in the indic. instead of making them depend gram-
matically on nescio an: they really explain the use of infestior
and are epexegetic. The authority of the best MSS. is rather
in favour of the indic.

§6. ominis eausa absit. Like the modern Turk the
ancient Roman apologized for the use of unlueky words, or
tried to undo their effects by others of happier sound-

demum=‘on1y when' or ‘not till.'

furere...1nsan1t. Do‘derlein ap. Fabri compares Cic. Tusc.
111. 5. 11, furorem esse rati mentis ad omnia coecitatem. Quod
quum majus esse videatur quam insania, tamen ejusmodi est,
ut furor in sapientem cadere possit, non possit insania.

ἐααξὲιὲὲο, 5 7. procellas to be taken with ciet, proelia with

§ 8. aut...aut. Here, as in some other places, these are
equivalent to ‘I ammi} n0t‚’ or ‘ If I arn not.’

59. adversus unum has been suspected as obscure and
eold, It might be taken to be a contrast between the speaker
