PREFACE.

THE text of Livy which is here adopted is a
reprint of Madvig's, whose Emendationes Livianae
discuss most of the important variations from the
common text. To that work therefore reference
is made when Madvig's authority or arguments
are mentioned in the notes.

In matters of Latinity the commentary of
Fabri, as enlarged by Heerwagen, has been found
most useful, especially the illustrations drawn
stom Latin authors. Weissenbornâ€™s notes for ,
German schools are quoted only (as W) when
they contain information which is not to be
found in earlier commentators,

In questions of etymology most stress is laid

upon the views of Corssen in his Ausspmche,
Vocalismus, u. Beton any der Lateinischen Sprache.
