Libuos, otherwise called Lai, Lebecii, Libioi, Laevi; proba-
bly petty tribes between the Orgus and Ticinus under the
supremacy of the Insubres. Their chief city was Vercellae,
(Libicorum ex Salluviis ortae, Pliny 111. 16).

ἓ 8. Semigermanis. This objection might apply to the great
St Bernard, but could have little force after the description
of the resistance which H. met with on his way from the moun-
taineers‚ whoever they were. The form Semiyermanis probably
suggested Madvig's reading Semiyalli above.

The answer to the etymological theory serves to show that
no local traditions of H. linger-ed on the great St Bernard, but
proves nothing as to the little St B.

Geneva. They are coupled together by Caesar, B. G. 111. 1, in
Verayros Sedunosque—qui a finibus Aliobroyum, et lacu Lemano
et flumine Rhodano acl summas Alpes pertinent, as also by Pliny,
111. 20. Strabo, Π. 6. 6, speaks of the Οὐάραγροι near the Leman
Lake, whose town Octodurus was near the site of Martigny.
The names were restored in the text by Lipsius and Gronovius
from the corrupt sed uno vel aeri of the best MSS.
