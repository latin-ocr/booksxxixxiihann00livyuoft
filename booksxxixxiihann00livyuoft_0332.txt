264 NOTES. XXII. c. mx. §lO—c. xx. §10

510. resolutis o.... ¹ Unfasten the cables (which bound
the stern of the ship to the shore), and arist towards the
anchors' (which were let down from the prow facing the sea
by ancoralia). The MSS. read eveherentur, which is ill
balanced by incidunt. W. reads evicti tenentur, which has
little to recommend it, but is suggested by the teneat which
follows.

P, 97, c. xx. The [in] probably, as Madvig suggests, was
a copyist’s error which grew out of the m in pretentam.

ἓ 2. quae non aut... The one set was not seaworthy, the
other had run aground and could not be towed away.

§4. Onusam. V. xm. 22. 5.

ξ 5. iniuncta m. ‘Which abutted on the walls) In forti-
fied towns a clear space was commonly left. For use of iniunctae
cf. v. 7. 1, quumv vineae tantum non iam iniunctae manibus essent.

ἓ 6. Longuntica must have been near Nova C., according to
a passage from Pliny 19. 2. 30, oestimare quanto sit in usu
(spartum)...narium armamentis machinis aedificationum ...... ad
hos omnes usus quae sufficiant minus triyinta millia passuum in
latitudinem a litore Cartha91'nis novoe minusque 0 in tonyitudi-
nem csse reperientur.

sparti. Sp. esparto. A natural grass which Pliny calls
iurwus proprie aridi soli...hinc strata rusticis eorum, hinc
iyncs facesque, hinc calceamina, et pastorum vestes. It was es-
pecially used for cordage on shipboard‚ in sicco prce-ferunt e
cannabi funes, Hence the name Spartarius Campus for the
neighbourhood of Carthago Nova.

ἓ 7. preelecta est ora. The MSS. reading is certainly cor-
rupt, proiectas oras or periectas. W. corrects it to praevecta
est oram (czassz's), but the change to the nent. pass, trans-
missum is much more awkward after a verb like proevecta used
actively, and therefore Madvig’s reading is to be preferred.

Ebusum. The largest of the Pityusae islands which lie
between the Baleares and the coast of Spain, now Iviza. Ibu—
sim=‘ pine islands‚’ Schro'der, p. 99.

§9- Baliaribus. Cf. XXI. 21. 12.

ἓ 10. provinciae. Spain was not yet regarded as a pro-
vincia, though steps had been taken in that direction by the
commission given to Scipio, but as W. remarks Livy is think-
ing of the later distinction of H isp. citerior et ulterior.
