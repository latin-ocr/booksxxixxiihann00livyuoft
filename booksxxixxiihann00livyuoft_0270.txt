204 N OTES. XXI. c. xxxvn. §4—0. xxxvm. §5.

obruunt nives. This might easily be the case so late in
the season. -

§5- apricosque etiam. The MSS. have apricos quosdam,
but the asyndeton is harsh. W. reads apricosque quosdam,
which is ugly and unusual.

et prope silvas=and almost foreste. Madv. inserts the et
as rivos p. s. seems to him unnatural.

ξ 6. locis momor. This is an abl. absol„ and the compar.
stands for a partic.

c. xxxvm. ξ 1. quinto mense a. Cf. xxn. 19. 5, altero ab
Tarracone die, an elliptical expression 3 the 5th month only is
qualified by the ‘ut quidam,’ the 15th day is accepted by Livy,
as by Polyb. But it is not easy to make their detailed state-
ments agree with this number, as both reckon 9 days to the
ascent, 2 at the top, 4 by the landslip, and 3 in the descent.
Probably however Polybius meant the last 3 to be counted as
part of the 4 just mentioned, in which the cavalry reached the
lower valleys while the road was being widened for the ele-
phants, and then we should get only 15 for the whole. There
is no hint of this however in Livy, who is hopelessly inconsist-
ent.

§2- qui minimum, eg. Polybius 111. 56, on the authority
of the tablet at Lacinium. We may note that with the excep-
tion of a few Ligurians there were no mercenaries in this army,
only Spaniards and Libyans, not like the motley aggregates
of earlier days.

ἓ 3. Cincius, v. Introduction on the authorities».
maxime... ‘Would be a most weighty authority)

ἓ 4. adducta. ‘Brought 'with him through the Alps:
most unlikely when there was a promise of more faithful allies
on the other side, who had more to gain from the Punic cause.

mag-is, take with ver-i simile; adducta and audisse after
scribit, to be understood after additia

auctores sunt, so xxm. 16. 15, quod quidam auctores sunt,
11. 58. 1, Piso auctor est, xxx, 3. 6, ita pars major auctores
sunt.

ἓ 5. Taurini Semigalli. This is a very bold correction by
Madvig of the corrupt readings of the MSS. : Taurini-summu,
Taurinis quae Gallice, Taurinisne Gallis, (fia, on the ground
that Strabo connects the Taurini with the Ligures, and yet dis-
tinguishes them as if they were half Celts. The conjecture of
W. Taurini Gallia’ seems preferable.
