ROUTE OF HANNIBAL. 315

Barmette in one account, or the rock of Baune according to
mother, and there are dangerous spots in the descent where
the road might easily be swept away. and old snow lie long
unmelted.

7. One argument indeed has been insisted on, that here
alone could a point of view be found upon the summit, com-
manding an extensive prospect of the Italian plain, such as
that which Hannibal is said to have had before him, when he
tried to revive the drooping courage of his soldiers. The spot
in question is not however on the road itself, but on a ridge
which was little likely to have tempted the weary men to need-
less efforts through the snow for the sake of a fine view. Nor
was the actual prospect of importance for the general's appeal.
The phrase of Polybius on which stress has been laid (ἐνάργεια)
more probably refers to the moral weight of evidence that Italy
{vas within easy reach, than to any actual picture stretched out

efore the eyes.

The language of Livy is too definite indeed to be mistaken,
in promontorio quodam, ubi lonae ac late prospectus erat,

- con-sistere jussis militibus Italiam ostentat....xx1. 35. 7. But

we must remember that Livy had little knowledge of the Alps;
that he may easily have given a different colouring to the
account of the general’s addi-ess which he found in the old
annalists; and that he was thinking more of rhetorical effect
than of strict accuracy of local statements.

The three passes hitherto described are very far from being
all of those whose rival claims have been supported. Almost
every height which could possibly be crossed, and some indeed
that are quite impassable 1⁴01· any but practised mountaineers,
have been at some time advocated as the pass of Hannibal.
Some routes have been disposed of by a quer knowledge of the
rugged country which lies between the Drac, the Romanehe,
and the Durance, and which until lately was almost unex-
plored, and ill described upon the maps. Some hopelessly
conflict with the main data of the ancient authors, and the
books or pamphlets written in their defence are only monu-
ments of misplaced ingenuity and learning. None of the‘se
seems now to call for serious discussion.

It should be stated in conclusion that the claims of the
Little St Bernard, or the Graian Alps, to be the pass intended
by Polybius were recognized by General Melville in 1775, whose
view was expanded by M. de Luc in 1818. Messrs Cramer
and Wickham in the Dissertation of 1820 supported the same
theory, and Mt Law in his masterly work upon the subject
seems to have proved decisively that the evidence points to that
conclusion, while Livy’s pass must be the Mont Genevre.
Niebuhr and Mommsen have accepted the authority of Poly-
bius in favour of the Graian Alps.
