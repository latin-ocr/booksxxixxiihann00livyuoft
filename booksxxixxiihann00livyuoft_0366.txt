298 NOTES. XXII. c. mv. §2—c.1.v. 56.

togas et tunicas. Cf. xxm. 36. 2, vestimenta exercitui de-
erant ...... mille clucentoe consemet duodecim millia tunicarum
missa. These were probably intended for winter clothing and
in the camp. They are only speeified here for the equites,
whose pay was usually three times as much as that of the
pedites. The larger number of tunicae in the passage quoted
eorresponds to the more frequent use of that dress by the lower
orders of Rome.

§h4. . et iam. The conjunction et has here au explanatory
emp asls.

d ἓ 7. ἶοεκιίᾱᾱοιιε oce. A favourite phrase of Livy for ⁸ totally
es royec .’

P. 13¹7, g 8. edissertando. Equivalent to si edissertavero.
The word is an unusual one except in Plautus, as Stich. 11. 1.
30, but Livy is fond of frequentatives, and the disserendo of
some MSS. is more likely a later variation.

ἓ 9. nuntiabantur nec ulla...esse. A change of construction
from the Or. dir. to the Or. obl. which is quite in Livy’s style
in rhetorical passages.

ς 11. compares scilicet. The best MS. has comparesset,
which suggested the present reading to Madvig.

vectigales ac stip. Cf. note on xm. 41. 7.

c. Lv. 51. curiam Hostiliam. The senate-house by the
Forum ascribed to Tullus Hostilius. Cf. 1. 30. 2, templum
ordini ab se aucto cur-iam fecit, quae Hostilia ‘usque ad patrum
nostrum <etatem appellata est.

ξ 2. neque dubitabant...venturum. This use of non dubito
-‘I do not doubt that' with the inf. is scarcely found in
Cicero, who always uses quin, unless perhaps in Ep. ad Att.
vn. 1, but it is common in Livy.

§3. nondum palamfacto, i. e. qui vivi mortuique essent.
Livy often uses the abl. abs. of the past part. without a sub-
stantive as permisso, edicto, debellato, in cases where a sentence
is taken as the subject to agree with it; but it is a further
licence, when it is used as here without any such relation. Of.
Tac. Ann. XI. 10. 3, in cujus amnis transqressu multum certato,
pervicit Bardaues.

54. profecto...fore‚ ‘surely there must be some? Cf. 1.
54. 1, invisam profecto superbiam regiam civibus esse, quam
ferre ue liberi quidem potuissent.

P. 138, ἓ 6. mud. Referring to the duties speeified
below. Of. 36. 5. ⁷
