on the Ticinus (ἕως τοῦ πρώτου ποταμοῦ) and capture the 600
who were left behind to break the bridge by taking up the
planks (σανίδες) which stretched from pier to pier. H. then
retires εἰς τάναντία παραὶ τὸν ποταμόν, that is hjgher up the
Po to find a suitable spot for crossing. Livy clearly implies
that H. crossed the Ticinus, and found the 600 engaged in
loosing the bridge of boats over the Po, which fioated down
the stream (in secundam aquam) when its end was untied.

any position in the neighbourhood. Niebuhr and others have
assumed that Scipio retreated to the east of Trebia, and that
Hannibal following him thither out him off from his com-

munications with Rome. This view seems quite untenable for
the following reasons:

taking up his position on hilly ground near it. If this new
