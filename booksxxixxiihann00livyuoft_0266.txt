200 NOTES. XXI. c. xxxw. 57—0. xxxv. §6.

fecit after acies is awkward: it connects two distinct state-
Ξιίὶῗῖτιέἐ of the manoeuvre of the infantry, and the experience of
Ο .

accipienda fuerit. Cf. the use of the participle in -urus
with fuerit, as 1v. 38. 2, nec dubium fuit quin si...ter9a daturi
hostes fuerint.

ἓ 8. ad extremum periculi. Cf. ad ultimum dimicationis,
acl i'HPPiLOE. ultimum, aci extremum spei, and like phrases com-
mon m 1vy.

demittere. ‘Risk sending.’ Cf. 111. 35. 1, demissa jam in

c. xxxv. ξ 1. latrocinii. Often conti-astet] with bellum, or
justum bellum, as xxxx. 6. 2, latrociniis magis quam iusto bello

P, 38, ἓ 4. Nono die. So Polyb. 111. 53, who however
fixes the point from which he reckons, and gives intermediate
dates, while Livy does neither. In fact, all his incidente and
particulare of time are taken from another route, and do not
suit his own; his reference to errores is probably to explain
the length of time which did not seem needful for the shorter
pass which he had chosen.

per invia pleraque. Cf. 32. 9, confragosa omnia.

(lucentium. ⁴ Absolutely for ‘ guidem) Ducentium fraus is
hardly consistent with the promise of the friends from Cisal-
pine Gaul to be duces itinerum, 29. 6.

initae valles. Cf. 1. 5, Sicilia S. amissoe.
ξ 5. stativa, sc. castra.

ς 6. occid. sidere Verg. ‘As the constellation of the

54, διὰ τὸ συνάπτειν τὴν τῆς Πλειάδος δύσιν. Pliny 11. 47. 125,
post id (autumni) aequinoctium diebus fere XLIV. Veryiliarum
occasus hiemem inchoat, quod tempus in 111. Idus Novembres
incidere consuevit.
