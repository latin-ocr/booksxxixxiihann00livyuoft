heaven, and skilled interpreter-S must piece them all together.
Yet some recurring portents were met always with like forms
01 ceremonial (procuratio). A shower 01 5101105 called for a
nine days' holiday, from the days of old king Tullus (mansit
solemne ut quandoque idem prodiyz'um nuntiaretur, serice per
novem dies aym-emur Livy 1. 31. 3). 11 a bull was heard to speak
with human sounds, a rneeting 01 the Senate was called in
open air (Pliny vr11.7O), 111 memory 01 the time perhaps when
Latin farmers met among their herds to discuss in conclave
the affairs 01 state.

When the scene 01 the p01tent was a shrine, or any clue
was given to the Power which sent the warning, the College
knew what offerings were likely to find favour, prescribed in
some cases the hostiae majores, the 11111- grown 0111111015, 0011-
1115οᾶ 111 later days with the beasts 01 larger srze, while in
other cases they could tell that tender sucklings (hostica
lactentes) would find most favour on the altars. Costly
gifts could seldom come amiss, as tokens 01 1110 votaries'
submission, so weighty offerings 01 gold or silver plate were ⁷
stored up in the temple treasuries, or the choicest works 01 art
in marble or in bronze were called in to represent the objects
01 popular gratitude or sear. In default 01 any special clue to
the nature of the offence, or 01 the offended power, it might at
least be well to have recourse to the ancient usage 01 lus-
tration, to clear away the stains of possible pollution. The
sin-offerings 01 the boar, the ram, the bull were duly made
(suovetaurtlaiah the priestly train moved round the city walls
(amburvium), or round the fields (ambarvalia), sprinkling the
consecrated clrops upon the bounds, and going through the
long round of the traditional prayer, some passages 01 which
Cato wrote out for like use among his country friends (De Re
Rustica 141 .

If the gxperience 01 the Pontifices was at fault, other
advisers were called in. The haruspices especially were skilled
in the Etruscan love 01 divination. They knew the language
01 the lightning, they could read strange characters scored
upon the slaughtered victims, and to them therefore were
referred the questions 011110 mysterious portents in the sky, or
in animals 01 monstrous birth.

11 1110 prodigies were fearful (taetra) and took the form 01
pestilence, or earthquake, or the like, and the need seemed
very urgent, a newer fashion sometimes superseded the old
machinery 01 the State Religion.

The Sibylline books had made their way to Rome, if we
may trust tradition, as early as the period of the Tarquins.
Borne to Rome by a wave 01 Hellenic influence which passed
from the coast 01 Asia Minor along the Greek cities 01
Campania, the prophetie utterances gained a sanction from
