as out of place, as the orat. dir. would run colloqui vobis-

§ 4. hospitem...non hostem. Livy much affccts the paro-
nomasia, ι. 58. 10, hostis pro hospite, V1. 26. 1, hospitaliter maqis
quam hostiliter.

§5. haec. For omission of verb cf. 42. 1, haec apud
Romanos consul.

gravanter. Livy more often uses ργαυαεε, also yravatz'm.

cum bona pace. ‘ Quite unmolested.’ In 32. 6 the phrase
is coupled with a gen. Gallorum.

c. xxv. ξ 1. In Italiam. These words if taken with trans-
miserunt may seem too remote an object for the safe-conduct
of the Gallio chieftains. They should probably be taken with
perlatum erat, and are further defined by the repetition of
Romam.

ξ 2. quum...defecerunt. Quum is used with the historical
perfect to imply simultaneous occurrence. Livy even employs
the historical infinitive, though rarely‚ in this sense with
quum.

behind it.

sse Boii are represented by Livy v. 35 as making their
way across the Alps with the Lingones, and finding the
North already occupied with Gallio settlers. They crossed the
Po therefore, and spread south of the AEmilian way under the
Apennines‚ towards the Hadriatic. So restless were they to
the last that the Romans found it needful to remove them to
the borders of Pannonia, where they perished utterly in wars
with the neighbouring Dacae. Strabo v. 1. 6.

The Insubres were the most numerous and powerful tribe
of the Cisalpine Gauls, Polyb. 11. 17. They were formed
of a number of distinct tribes, described by Livy v. 34 as
crossing the Alps in early times, and founding Mediolanum
(Milan), after the name of a city of the AEdm' in Gaul.

P, 26. colonias. These illustrate the Roman system of
colonization which did so much to consolidate their empire,
and which marked from time to time each successive wave oi
conquest. They were of two classes, the Roman strictly so
