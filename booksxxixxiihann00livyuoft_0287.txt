NOTES. XXI. c. xmx. ᾖ 2-8. 219

52. novem 1.. ‘9 reached L.’ It seems better to under-
stand some verb such as aetiyerunt, rather than assume a dif-
ferent construction in two clauses with tenuerunt (cursum) with

and without ad, though both constructions are freely used by
Livy, as 1. 1. 3, xxn. 22. 2. Strabo, 1v. 2. 10, speaks of the seven

Liparaean islands, of which the greatest was Lipara. The
plural may be used for the town as W. suggests, or be used
for the islanda generally. Cf. v. 28. 2.

insulam Vulc. Its name was Thermessa, ἣν νῦν ἱερὰν
Ἡφαίστου καλοῦσι. Strabo gives a long account of volcanic
action visible on the island, which lay between Sicily and the

Liparae group.
§3- merone. Like Hanno at Carthage, Hiero of Syra-
cuse lived to remember the lst Punic war, in which he had

borne an important part. At first an ally of Carthago he
transferred himself soon to the winning side, to which he was

uniformly faithful.
nullo repugnante. ‘ Without resistance.’

ἓ 4. veteres socios. A great part of Sicily once belonged
to Carthage, but they were gradually driven to the Western
Coast, and held only Motye Solois and Panormus. In the
rivalries of the Greek republics they found frequent occasions
of interference, as the weaker party in the struggle turned to
them for help. The lst war however put an end to that, and

secured the island to Rome.

Ρ, 54, § 6. sicma. prov. It was strictly speaking assigned
to Sempronius, but as he was possibly to cross into Africa,

the Praetor AEmilius was also appointed to it.

Τ §7-> legati. Besides the envoys so called, who were sent

on extraordinary missions, there were regular officere, attached
to the consular army, or the legion, as lieutenant-generals.

tribuni. Attached to each legion, six in number.

§8- The whole passage is very corrupt in the MSS.. but
the corrections of Madvig have been generally received. His
earlier suggestion of strepere for teneri has not been admitted
into the text. The change of form from missi (sunt) to teneri
is in itself awkward, the MSS. read et ubi... ue quis moram,
to which Madvig objects that the terms of the edict would be
general, and not addressed to the sailors individually‚ and he
therefore corrects it to ne quid, which would explain the
object of the foregoing direction. The et he changes to ut,
but this seems questionable. Ut ne is a pleonasm used by
Cicero, but rarely by later writers, and Drakenborch doubts
whether Livy wrote it in the three passages in which the MSS.
