there is no reason to suppose that the plans of Hannibal could
have been foreseen.

c. xvn. ξ 1. The term provincia is strictly used only in con-
nexion with the imperium of a Roman magistrate, that is with
military and judicial functions. For this reason, as for others,
we must reject the derivation from providentia which is often
given for it, together with that from proventus of Niebuhr, and
accept the old derivation from provincere (‘to be the mightiest’)
of Festus, though his words vinciam dicebant continentem...
provinciae quod eas pop. Rom. provicit seem wrongly to rest-rict
thc use of the term to land beyond the seas, and to point to
the conquest rather than the rule. The Annalists employed
it early for the limits of each consul's sphera of military action.
Thus Livy 11. 40. 14, (Aquilio Hernici provincia evenit3 for
some such division of functions must have been needful from
the first, though not constitutionally binding. As the senate's
influence increased, it claimed more right to define the work
of the executive from year to year, or nominare provincias, or
in less appropriate terms decernere (c. 6. 6); but the several
departments were decided by lot (sortiri) or by agreement (com-
parare inter se provincias, ...extra sortem eoncedente collega).

The principle of division was extended to the praetorship
when two forms of jurisdiction were distinguished, and with the
conquest of Sicily a precedent was set for the new system of
departments locally distinct from the executive centralized at
Rome. Each of these provinces in the latter sense was ruled
by a governor invested with an imperium which covered mili-
tary and judicial functions.

ἓ 2. socium, quantum 1. v. Such discretionary power
was not commonly vested in the consuls, unless by special
commission as in this case. The policy of Rome was to throw
more and more of the military burdens upon the allies, who
had been gradually brought closer to R„ and severed from each
other by distinct ties of relationship to the central city.

Note the contracted form of the gen. plur. which is ire-
quently used in this word as in deum, modium, jugerum, de·
narium. Cf. Cic. Orat. 157, alias ita loquor ut concessum est,
ut hoc vel ‘pro deum' dico vel ‘pro deorum ', alias ut necesse
est, cum ‘ trium virum' ‘non virorum, cum ‘sestertium ‘nummum’
non nummorum, quod in his consuetudo varia non est.
