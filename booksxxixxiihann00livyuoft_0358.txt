ἓ 2. trans fiumen. Hannibal’s camp was on the same
side of the river as the greater Roman camp, and opposite to

ἓ 7. pedites, i.e. sociorum. Polyb.‚ who agrees closely
with Livy, adds here a detail of importance, that the infantry
was drawn up in much greater depth of ranks than usual.
Both writers state that the Roman line faced southwards, cf.
46. 8, and imply that the Roman army was drawn up before
the Carthaginians crossed, but neither says definitely whether
tho battle was on the right or left bank. But it would have
been absurd for the Romans to make their line of battle face
to the south, with their right resting on the river, if the enemy
was still on the opposite bank, or behind them, as 116 would
have been, assuming that he was encamped on the left bank.
The battle no doubt took place on the left bank, and the
Roman lines were probably drawn across the chord of the arc
formed by the river opposite Cannae. This agrees also with
what is implied as to the position of the Carthaginian camp.
