they consulted the material interests of the poorer
classes, at the same time respecting their pride of
sels-respect even while ruling in their name.

Of the people itself we know not much, but we
may do their memory a wrong if we repeat without
misgiving the comments of the Greeks or Romans.
It is idle to say they were effeminate because they
mostly did not care to fight themselves in foreign
wars. The Phoenjcians, of whose race they came,
were no soldiers, but they were no cowards. It
needed courage and the spirit of adventure to make
their way among wild racesz, to brave the dangers
of the unknown waters, and be the pioneers of civi-
lized progress It is true that they had not, like
the Romans, the barbaric pride which thought that
war was noble, but industry was mean: they had
little mind to fight for imperial interests which did
not move then] greatly, and were well content to
see their rulers buy soldiers in a cheaper market.
It is rash to say they had no sense of honour, be-
cause Aristotle tells us that offices of state were
bought and sold. It may be true to own that in
their race the political instincts were less strong than
other motives, but we shall do well to remember that
the French monarchy with all its talk of honour sold
public offices by thousands, and if it be a question
simply of bribery at elections, Englishmen had, till
lately, little right to condemn others.
