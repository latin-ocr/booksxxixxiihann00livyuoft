Italian contingente as 700‚000 foot and 70‚000 horse. He
asks the question 1. 64 why in later days of empire she could

no longer put such forces on the field.

inter sese, sed. Heerwagen notes that the alliteration was
in such cases less displeasing to Roman than to modern ears,
cf. Cic. opt. gen. or. 2. 6, nec yeneribus inter scae sed facultati-

bus different.

artes conserebant is formed on the analogy of picqnam or
manus conserere. The reading conferebant found in some MSS.
is approved by Ruperti and by Madvig as a more natural
expressmn.

expertas primo Punico, i. e. each of the combatants had
learnt its rival’s skill by the experience of the first war. Yet
the naval skill oi Carthage was comparatively little used in
the Qud war, probably because the Barcine party had neglected
the fieet. But Hamilcar had given proof of a genius like that
of Hannibal in his power ol welding into unity a motley host
of various nationalities.

propius p. q. vicerunt. Rome, though victorious was
brought to the brink of tuin by the early successes of Han-
nibal. Muretus notes that Silius Italicus in the corresponding
passage writes propiusque fuere periclo Ι queis superare datum.
Livy elsewhere often uses the aec. as xxn. 40. 5, propius Hau-
nibalem, iv. 17. 3, propz’usfizstm, xxm. 12. 4, quo propius spem.
vicerunt here used absolutely, cf. xxm. 13. 4, quam (pacem)
quum vincimus, dat nemo.

superbe, in threatening war and taking Sardinia3 avare in
raising the war indemnity by 1200 talents. Polyb. 111. 10.

crederent does not properly balance inferrent, as it rather
repeats than justifies the idea of the word indignantibus, and
the subj. is due to a looseness of style asin Cio. Phil. 11. 4,
at etiam literas, quas me sibi misisse diceret, recitavit homo.

imperitatum. Livy has a special affection for frequenta-
ti ve forms, and often uses this one.

ἓ 4. Fama est. Polyb. 111. 11 says that H. himself told
this story to Antiochus in later days. Cf. Livy, xxxv. 19.

annorum novem. The gen. of the quality is here imme-
diately connected with a proper name as in 111. 27. 1, L.

veritatis. Fabri.
