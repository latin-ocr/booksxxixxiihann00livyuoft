258 NOTES. XXII. c. xm. §g 1—9.

Telesiam. This was a little north of Beneventum and
should probably be read in Pol. 111. 90 instead of Venusia,
which was quite off the line of march.

§3. res mai. q. a. Note the compression oi this phrase
‘the enterprise was greater than its authors,' i. e. ‘too critical
to be under-taken on their authority alonez'it qualifies dubium.

§4. etiam atque etiam. Connected by Madvig with mo-
nitos, though the MSS. put the ut between. It is possible
however to take them with promissa elliptically. Lucretius
uses the phrase still more independently as 1. 296 Quare etiam
atque etiam sum venti corpora caeca.

aliquibus. Fabri remarks that aliquis is the more usual
form oi the abl. 'm Livy, though this form is here well attested.

§5. Agrum casinatem. This is the point at which the
via Latina issued from Latium into Campania, and the old
name remains in the famous Benedictine cloister of the Monte
Cassino. As the Appian Way was open to the Romans with
the other roads Hannibal could not have barred their way to
Capua except by forcing a battle. '

ξ 6. abhorrens Cf. xxx. 32. 10.

casilinum was on the Volturnus not far from Capua, and
the Campus Stellatis lay along the right bank of the river to
the sea. It was one of the last districts of the ayer publicus to
be divided.

Polyb. says nothing of this mistake of the guido, but makes
H. move towards Campania in the hope of plunder in the rich
Falernian plain, and of revolt among the towns; and there
could be little meaning in a movement towards Casinum, if the
plain of Capua was the real object of the march.

Corssen 11. 355 connects both Casinum and Casilinum with
casa, casula as originally ‘a place of huts’ like the German
termination -hausen as in Frankhausen.

ς 7. montibus. The Callicula and Massicus,
fluminibus. The Savo and Volturnus.

ξ 8. mansurum. ‘rest,’ ‘pass the night.’ Cf. Hor. Carm. 1.
1. 25, manet sub Jove frigido Ι venator, so also mansiones were
‘night quarters’ for travellers or soldiers, before they became
⁴ mansions' in our sense.

P, 89, ς 9. The ager Palmum, which was famous for the
best wine in Italy, lay to the North of the Campus Stellatis,
between Sinuessa and Casilinum.
