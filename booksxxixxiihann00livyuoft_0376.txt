The value of this passage turns upon the meaning of is
saltus. ,It might refer solely to the pass of Hercules, but as
the writer must have known the traditione of the Gallie hordes
who crossed the Alps, it is more probable that he is specially
referring to the Graian chain, as that over which both Hercules
and Hannibal had passed.

4. Some lines of Varro, the learned writer on antiquities
at the close of the Republic, are quoted for us by Servius in
his commentary on Vergil x. 13: quas (Alpes) quinque viis
Varro dicit transiri posse : una quae est juxta mare per Ligures.-
altera qua Hannibal transiit: tertia qua Pompeius ad His-
paniense bellum profectus est: quarta qua Hasdrubal cle Gallia
in Italiam venit : quinta quse quondam a Graecis possessa est,
(μίας exinde Alpes Graioe appellantur.

5. Strabo, who wrote under Tiberius, cites Polybius as men-
tioning four passages across the Alps: τέτταρας ὑπερβάσεις
ὀνομάζει μόνον· διὰ Λιγύων μὲν, τὴν ἔγγιστα τῷ Τυρρηνικῷ
πελάγει · εἶτα τὴν διοὶ Ταυρίνων, ἢν Ἀννίβας διῆλθεν· εἶτα
τὴν διὰ Σαλασσῶν· τετάρτην δὲ διὰ Ραιτῶν. IV. 6. 12. Here
it should be noted that the important words ἦν A. δ. do not
appear in a MS. of great value (Ep. Vat. 482), that if genuine,
they may easily have been transplaced, or that they may be
regarded as a comment of Strabo, rather than an extract from
Polybius. Strabo himself shows elsewhere little interest
in the route of Hannibal, and does not mention it where it
would naturally occur.

Now if we turn to the third book of Polybius we shall find
that the whole journey from Carthago Nova to the Italian plains
is definitely measured. We are told that there were 2600
stadia to the river Iberus, and thence to Emporeion 1600, and
1600 more to the passage of the Rhone. From the Rhone to
the beginning of the Alps (πρὸς τὴν ἀναβολήν ταῖν Ἀλπέων)
there were 1400, while the remainder of the way (λοιπαὶ αἱ τῶν
Α. ὑπερβολαί) was 1200 stadia.

As far as the Pyrenees there is no doubt about the route,
but much depends upon the place at which the Rhone was
crossed, as that becomes the starting-point for future measure-
ments.

The description of Polybius clearly indicates a passage near
the town of Orange, about the village of Roquemaure, as that
is halfway between the river⁷s mouth and its junction with the
Isere, while it should be according to the histor-ian four days’
march to either point. The actual distance of 75 miles to the
Isere is in close harmony with the 600 stadia implied in his
latter statements. There is also a long stretch of broad stream
unbroken by any islands to suit with the words κατὰ τὴν
