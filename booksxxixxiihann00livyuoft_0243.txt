ancient custom of slaughtering an animal (porcus) as an im-

auctoritate patrum. This phrase is here used in its most
general sense as the sanction of the senate, as the great govern-
ing power in the state. But it has also more specific sonses.
(1) In early times possibly the patrician members oi the senate
had the right oi veto on any popular vote of the comitia; their
sanction or patrum auctoritas was expressed by the formula
patres auctores fiunt. Their action was gradually confined to
questions of procedure and ceremonial usage, and by the Pub-
lilian law 338 13.c., their assent was required before the result
of the voting was known, 1. 17. 9, in incertum comitiorum even-
tum patres auctores fiunt, vm. 12. 16, ante initum suffragyimn.
(2) The action of the senate was subject to the veto oi the
tribunes, but in such case oi interierence, the resolution come
to, though it could not technically rank as a senatus consal-
eum, was protocolled‚ and quoted as a patrum auctoritas, as
the old sense of the term patres became fainter. Cf. Momm-
sen, Romische Forschungen‚ 233—249.

dolor populi Romani pariat, quod jam diu parturit.

which might serve as a pocket.

514. 1terum ‘in reply,' not qualifying sinu effuso, but the
whole sentence.

c. xlx. 5 1. ante...sagunto. We should naturally expect
post Saquntum excisam to balance the ante. The feminine
participle seems used per synesim of urbem understood with Sa-
guntum as Mela 11. 6. 92 S. fide inclitam and an Inscr. G. I. L. 11.
3836, ob restitutam Saguntum. The feminine form Sayuntus
is only known in later writers J uv. xv. 114, Florus 1. 22. Discep-
tare varies the form of the phrase for disceptatio, which would
correspond to percontatio.

ἕ 2. Nam si. There is here an ellipse ‘though the Romans
had arguments to urge, for διο) Fabri.

P. 20. quid. ‘To what purpose,' ‘in what respect.’
