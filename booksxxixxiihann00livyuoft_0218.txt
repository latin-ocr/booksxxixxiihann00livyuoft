m Hispania. The Phoenieians had in remote ages planted
colonies on the coast of Spain, which fell in time under the
influence of Cartlmge. The wealth of the mines tempted her
to push her way further inland, but no great progress had been
made till Hamilcar annexed much 01¹ the South, and changed
the imperial poliey oi Carthage. The vast revenues of the
mines and the hardy material for soldiers were the chief ob-
jects in view; like Caesar, he went to conquer a province, and
organize an army for future uses. It is carious to contrast the
specdy conquests made by these generals with the slow progress
of Rome in finally subduing Spain. In a later age the Arabs,
of Semitic race(possibly)akin to that of Carthage‚ possessed
themselves oi Southern Spain, and attained to a high degree
of power and culture, in the Moorish kingdoms of Cordova
and Granada.
