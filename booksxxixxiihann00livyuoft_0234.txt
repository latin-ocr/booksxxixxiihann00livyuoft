168 NOTES. XXI. c. XI. §g 1—7.

more often in putting nomen after cognomen as Crassus
Licinius, Antias Valerius.

ἓ 2. ortum ab S. Polyb. 111. 15 refers to a despatch from
H. to Carthago complaining of aggressione of the Saguntines
on the Carthaginian subjects. Sayuntinos short for Sagunti-
norum societatem. cf. 1x. 10. 1, Postumium...devotitme Ρ.
Decii...aequabant‚ and many h'ke examples in Livy,

Ρ, 12, vetustissimae. The earliest treaty of R. with G.
dated from 508 Β. c.

§3. fessum habebat. The verb habere, besides its auxi-
liary use, implies the continuance of the result. Cf. Cic. Rep.
111. 14. 24, quum quaereretzir ex eo quo scelere impulsus mare
haberet infestum uno myoparone. Fam. 14. 7. 1, sollicitudines
quibus te miserrimam habui. So Lucr. 1. 1068 amplexi quod
habent perverse prima viai.

ira...stimulando. The abl. accompanied by the gerundis
awkward. The MSS. do not vary, though Gronovius reads
stimulanda, but Fabri observes that Livy does not use stimu-
lare iram, but st. aliquem or animum, in other places. Usener
supposes promittendo to have slipped out of the second half of
the sentence, in which there is a want of balance.

§4- contio for conventio is used for an assembly in the
city, or the camp, as also for an harangue prononnced on such
occasions, so pro contio-nez‘ publicly.'

§ 7. turris The moveable tower (t. ambulatoria) of later
times is described by Vegetius‚ 1v. 17, as 30 to 50 feet square,
and so high as to overtop, not the walls only, but the towers of
the besieged city. It 'was covered with raw hides to be
screened from fire, and was moved along on rollers to the
point of attack. In the lowest story was contained a battering
ram, in the middle was a drawbridge, which might suddenly
be lowered and secured with grappling irons to the walls for a
boarding party, while the higher stories were filled with men
who poured a shower of missiles of every kind upon the
enemy.

catapultis. Latinized form of καταπέλτης from πάλλω.
With it we may possibly connect pilum. Corssen‚ 11. 157.

hamst1s. See the description in Vegetius w. 22, Ballista
