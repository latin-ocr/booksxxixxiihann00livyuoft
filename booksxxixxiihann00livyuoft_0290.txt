222 NOTES. XXI. 0.L1. §3-0. LII. 52.

§3- insulas vulcam. Here used as a general expression
for the whole group of the Liparae, of which Thermessa was

specially ins. Vulc.

ξ 4. nam forte is a probable correction of Madvig for jam
forte, which is abrupt and unusual.

Viboniensi agro. In the west os Bruttium. The Locrian'
colony of Hipponium was taken by Rome and called Vibo

Valentia. Strabo VI. 1. 5.

ἓὸ. mari supero. The terms superum and insemm are
commonly used of the Adriatic and Tyrrhenian seas respec—
tively. Polybius says, 111. 61, that the legionaries were told to
make their way as they could to Ariminum at a fixed date,

probably because the transports were not sufficient for so large
a force. It will be seen that the R. generals did not spare the

marching powers of the soldiers‚ if, as Polyb. states, they
reached Ariminum in 40 days from Lilybaeum, 111. 68.

ἓ 7. oram legens. So litora legens, xxxv. 27. 6. The
shorter road across the Apennines from Genoa was avoided,

as the Ligurians could not be depended on to allow the army
a safe passage, while on the great read, which was afterwards

thetgiaIZ'Emiliffi they were nearer to the colonies and magazines
on e 0.

profectus ad Trebiam. Nothing is said of the route of
Sempronius, or of any attempt of Hannibal to prevent a
junction of the two consular armies, yet we should expect to
hear of this, if H. had been between the two, as most critics

have believed.

c. Lu. ξ 1. The subject to declarabat is the sentence ambo
cons. et q.‚ which in English we should make an independent
clause, ‘as both consuls, &a ...it was clear.'... This is a feature
of Livy's involved style, as is also the use of the past part.

oppositum, for an abstract subst. oppositio.

spem nullam al. This is absurd, for Italy could raise
many armies, as was proved by the muster-rous given by
Polyb. just before 111 the Gallie war.

ἓ 2. The et minutus of the MSS. is no doubt corrupt; even
if some word has dropped out minutus, though not impossible,
is harsh for ‘dispirited,’ for the Homeric μινύθειν quoted in
illustration does little to support the reading. Madv. doubt-
fully suggests admonitus instead.

trahi rem. Used also 11. 61. 5, like the colloquial ‘drag
{Azaga-so trahere bellum, comitia, dec„ and extrahere, pro-
