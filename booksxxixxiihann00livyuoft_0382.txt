though differing in details, agree in the main features 01 the
route, which they assume to have passed along the Southern
bank 01 1110 13010, across the Drac and the Romanche, and up
the Val de Gresivaudan‚ at some point 01 which the beginning
of the mountain ground is reckoned which extends over the
heights that part the valleys 01 the Arc and of the Doria.
They agree also in the attempt to reconcile the statements of
both the ancient authors, by correcting them pretty freely where
they see the need. In this we may note especially the following
points.

1. It is supposed that Polybius mistook the Isere for the
Rhone, though he travelled himself over the ground, and stated
{Rathtgg 13183131 kept near the latter river till they began to olimb

2. The Allobrogem, who are recorded as the native tribes
with which the invaders came into collision in their way up
to the Alps, are commonly assigned to the North 01 the Isere,
which was afterwards the insula Allobroqum. The theory be-
fore us transfers them without the slightest evidence, to the
southern bank, assuming that they had no definite borders,
or that the name itself was quite a vague one, loosely used for
Gallie tribes, and possibly still lingering in the Allevard near
St J ean de Maurienne.

3. The march along the Isere inverte the description 01
Polybius. In the earlier stages the Carthaginians must have
moved over rugged country ill suited for their horse, and ex-
posed to native onsets, while the easier ground comes higher
up in the Val de Gresivaudan, and no definite point can be
agreed on to suit the measurement 01 distance given.

4. The passage 01 the Romanche would have been formid-
able in the face of the Gauls, who are described as repelled only
by the cavalry or by the succour 01 3 friendly chieftain.

5. The Druentia of Livy must be explained to be the Drac,
which the track in question crossed, while it lay far away from
the Durance, for which Druentia is the undoubted name in
ancient times, known as it was as the line 01 communication
across the Alps with Spain. <

6. The character 01 1110 Μο111 Cenis itself has been com-
pared minutely with the narrative before us, and with some
forcing 01 1110 text it 1133 been shown that the measurements
of time and distance may possibly be verified. We need not
stay to discuss these attempts. It is not difficult to find some
features 01 resemblance in almost every pass to the soenes and
incidents described upon the march, and 11 they were the only
data we might well despair 01 any definite conclusion. White
rocks can be found also near the road, such as that de 13
