196 NOTES. XXI. c. xxxn. §g 1—7.

Ρ, 34⁵ c. xxxii. ἓ 1. triduo. The orossing-place was four

Scipio's camp.
movit, as often, absolutely for se movit, or castra.

§2 videt. Here, as 33. 3, two distinct uses of the verb
are o'ombined, physica] and. mental vision.

tutius ita. Because his own troops would be fresh, and
those oi H. exhausted or thinned by the long march. Ita
carries a good deal of meaning by implication.

ξ 3. nuda auxiliis. This policy was aimed at the real
base of H's operatione, and the source to which he looked for
reinforoements. Arnolti says, “Had Scipio, at this critical
junctura, not sent his army to Spain...‚ his son would in all
probability never have won the battle of Zama.'' Yet had
Scipio been ready with a larger army to attack the wearied.
troops of H. as they issued from the mountain-pass—and

§6. ab Druentia. His course would be rather ‘along’

pace incolentium. For the gen. ef. the expression Luer.

§ 7. The following description is somewhat absurd as
applied to the lower Alpino valleys, and is a bit of fine writing
in which Livy gives full scope to his rhetorical taste, working
upon the description of some traveller‚ who exaggerated the
horrors of Γ Journey. Note the absence of any sense of the
grandeur oi ,ountain scenery, which was possibly, as Macaulay
suggests, overbowered by the sense of danger. In general the
sense of the picturesque is of modern growth. Polybius, who
had himself travelled over the ground, is much more guarded
in his language, and guilty of no such exaggerations as Livy.
