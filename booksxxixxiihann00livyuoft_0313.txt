news to his coneague who was hurrying up to bar the way to
Rome. Had he wished to force a battle sooner, he could cer-
tainly have done so in the valley of tho Arno. When H.
marched towards Rome, he could hardly fail to follow, as tho
course of Servilius naturally lay through Umbria, and he
was not strong enough to face the invader single-handed on
the Flaminiar] way. The distance between Arretium and the
Lake Trasimene is not great, ancl Flaminius may perhaps
have moved first towards Clusium to strengthen the defences
on the Via Cassia, and then pushed eastward in the track of
H.. to keep his communications open with his colleague. He
naturally hoped to effect a speedy junction, and to orush H.
with their united forces, as the Gauls had been in like case
defeated a few years before at Telamon. No fault in strategy
can be proved up to the eve of the battle, when he allowed
himself to be ensnared. Cf. Append. on the Charaeter of
Flaminius.

Polyb. calls it Ταρσιμένη λίμνη, and it is often spelt Trasumenus,
as we read Porsena and Porsenna. The Etruscan names
Vibenna‚ Sisenna, δια, support the double n of the best MSS„
