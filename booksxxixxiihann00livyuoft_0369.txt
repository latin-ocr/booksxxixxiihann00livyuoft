NOTES. XXII. c. nvn. 56—0. Lvrn. §8- 301

the Decii, and in the elaborate formula quoted by Livy v111. 9.
5, point to an early sacrifice of human victims. The ancient
usage οἰ the ver sacrum has probably a like bearing. A few
years before there had been a similar case in the Gallio war.
The language of Pliny implies that the victims bore a repre-
sentative character, as did the Decii in their devotion for
Rome. Pliny N. Η. 38. 2, Boario vero in soro Graecum Groe-

eamque defossos aut aliarum gentium, eum quibus tum res esset,
etiam nostra aetas vidit.

Arma, tela, alia.. An example of asyndeton frequent in

5 11. servitiis, the abstraet for the concrete servi, of fre-
quent use in L.

vellentne militare. Hence the name volones applied to
them: according to Macrobius 1. 11. 30 it was not the first
time they had been used.

c. min. ς 2. sicut ante ad Trebiam. This was not men-
tioned by Livy at the time, though in 7. 5 it was specified in
the case of the prisoners at L. Trasimene. ’

§t3. nt...et... imply a conti-ast rather than a mere con-
junc lon.
