miique utriusque pasrtis exercituum hibernis viderent,
verterunt retro Hannibalem odia. So faulty a MS.
can be little trusted in nice questions of orthography,

and Madvig accordingly has not attempted to re· ,

produce the forms of Livy's age, or to give us the
spelling of the historian himself, but has fallen back
upon the orthography of Quintilian's age, which was
fixed by the authority of critics and grammarians,
and which is known to have differed in material
points from that of Livy's time, when it was still
shifting and unsettled. It may be convenient how-
ever to formulate some of the chief points of dif-
ference between the spelling most in vogue at the
end of the Republic, and that of a century later,
though with the caution that we cannot tell exactly
when the change in each case took place, or how far
personal taste- may have modified the general fashion,

O. V. vo was at first usual, as in servos, volnus.
The change to vu took a century 'to effect, from
Augustus to Vespasian, cf. Quintilian 1. 7. g 26.

O. E. The change from vorteae to vertex begar
with Scipio Africanus, but some forms advorsus, con—
troversia, voster lasted till the Empire, when there
was doubt between samoris, foeneris, &a

V. E. We have the later form of the gerundive
of the third and fourth conj. as early as nc. 185, but
the older form, as faciundas, appears much later,
especially in archaic formularies.

V. Ι. Maxumus, optumus were common before
