latum cum Graecis esset, Liv. vm. 23. 7. But to mark the dis-
tinctive character of this prorogatio in this and other cases the
official was always spoken of not as mayistratus but pro myis-
trata, and for a long time a vote os the people as well as a
resolution of the senate was needed. It was at first resorted to
only in the case oi imperium militiae, or the highest command
away from Rome, and never to the imp. domi, in which a
proefectus iuri dicundo or an interrex stepped into· the place of
an absent or deceased official. It waS, however, spar'mgly
adopted in case of lower offices at Rome. With the institution
of provinciae the prorogation became a regular procedure, and a
proconsul or propraetor was appointed for each, but towards the
end of the Republic an interval oi at least 5 years was required
between the office of consul and proconsul, praetor and pro—
praetor.

P, 99, ξ 2. portum Τ. Hiibner remarks that Strabo calls
Τ. ἀλίμενος 111. 4. 7, and that it is still one of the worst roads
on the Spanish coast, though Eratosthenes spoke of a ναύσταθ-
μον there. Yet 8 years later C. Claudius Nero sailed direct
from Puteoli to Tarraco, XXVI. 17. 2, though the troops more
commonly disembarked at Emporiae and marched to T.‚ until
the fall of Carthago Nova changed the centre of operations.

ξ 4. nec ullo viso, for et nullo, as the negative belongs not
to the main sentence, but to the secondary clause. This con-
fusion is of frequent occurrence in Livy, cf. vn. 9. 1, quum...
excercitum duxissent neque inventis in agro hostibus Ferentinum
...cepissent.

traditos, i.e. to the governor of the gan-ison. They were
left there, says Polybius, because oi the strength of the place
and the supposed fidelity of the guard, 111. 98.

ἓ 5. liberum. The contracted form of this gen. plur. is
very usual in Livy as in duum and socium.

emolumentum. The abstract for the concrete, as semina

56. 9. The object of Abelux was not merely that the ⁴ gain
might be as great as possible' taking emolumentum as the
subject, but that he might ‘himself profit his new allies.'
For this the natural construction would be emolumento esset,
though in Cic. de fin. 11. 18 the best MSS. have cuius mors tibi
emolumentum factura¹ sit.
