esse, necesse non cese : se quoniam etc senatus consulto provin·
ciam haberet, leae Cornelia ἱηιΡει-ἰιιιη habiturum.

56. 111. i.e. auspicium, or sanction of heaven. Tho idea
was that the will of the Gods {Eould be consulted in every
important detail ot national life, and that it was declared by
gigne, ex caelo, ez avibus, ex tripudiis, ea: animalibus, or ea:

aru.

P. 73, 5 7. externo solo. For national auspices the place
ot observation‚ or templum, must be on national soil.

concipere. On this use cf. v. 17. 2, Latinas sacrumque
in meme Albano non rite concepisse, hence the serice con·
ceptivoe.

Οἱ the prodigies mentioned here, and in xxx. 62, many were
entirely the creatione of a morbid imagination, others were
only distorted versions of natural phenomena mjsunderstood,
as in the fall of meteoric stones, or in red water tingecl by the
soil through which it fiowed. Some were monstrosities of
nature, as in the cases of strange births. Some like thunder-
storms, with the accompaniments ot danger, were only noted
when men's minds were ill at rest.

§8- scipionem. Connected with σκῆπτρον. It is curious
to note the contrast between the derivations of the Greek
nameS, with their associations of ‘honour,' ‘glory‚' ‘demus‚⁷
δια, and the humbler origin of the Roman family names, such
as Scipio (stigk), Kaeso (the hard hitter), Fabius (bean), Len-
tulus (pulse), Naso (nose), Piso (pea), Cicero (vetch). In
reference to the Scipiades belli fulmen used by Lucretius and
Vergil, as also to the phrase duo fulmina applied by Cicero
(pro Balbo, 34), to the two Cn. and P. who met a disastrous
end in Spain, Mr Mum-o obser-vce, ¹ When we think of Scipio,
scapus, shast, σκίπων, σκῆπτρον, and then σκηπτός, σκήπτω, We
might be tempted to think that the Scipios loved to refer their
name to it rather than to the more homely staff! (Note on
Lucr. 111. 1034).

ἓ 10. niteram. Plautus has the form interdius, as he
has dius for diu in quam dius vivo. Corssen 1. 290 connects
interdius and diurnus, like dies hodiernus with the Sanscr.
divas, and regards interdiu, not as an ablativo, but as a neuter
accusative form, the s having dropped off, in this respect
like postea, antea, interea, all of which he regards as acc.
forms. Cf. 11. 455.

caeretes. cf. Drakenb. Utrumque C'oerites et Coeretes apud
ipeum Livium leyitur.
