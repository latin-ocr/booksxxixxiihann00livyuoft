184 NOTES. XXI. c. xxm. §2—0. xxw. ἓ 3.

Laeetania. The MSS. have Aquitania, but as this lay
north of the Pyrenees‚ Sigonius corrected it to Laeetania, the
seat of a devia et silvestris qens, mentioned in xxvn1. 24. 4,
and in 3 places of xxinv. 20, as also in Pliny 111. 22 and
Sallust Hist. 11. 5. Strabo speaking seemingly of the same
tribe as γνωριμώτατον, 111. 4. 10, 011 the slope of the Pyrenees
towards Osca and Ilerda, calls them Ἰακκητανοί, as also does
Ptolemy, 11. 6. 72. Mommsen suggests that the name began
with a consonant which was between I and L, something like
the Spanish ll=lj‚ and that the Romans took one part and
the Greeks another of the composite sound. We should pro-
bably distinguish from this tribe the one referred to in 60. 3.
Cf. Hiibner in Hermes 1. 337.

orae. The strip of coast through which the roads must
run.

§4 inexsuperabili Alp. As ii the Spaniards were likely
to know much of the Alps, or of Hannibal's plans. Thr-ough-
ont Livy assumes that all was patent beforehand.

P. 25, ξ 5. revocare aut... ‘It would be hazardous to
summon them to return, as he might have to use force to
detain them.' On this use of aut cf. xxu. 39. 8.

§6. remisit. In sending so many home H. showed his
reliance on moral forces as distinet from numbers, like Gideon
at the well oi Harod.

et ipsos. Altered by Madvig and others from the etipse of
all MSS. Fabri however defends the MSS. reading by a
number of passages from Livy in which et ipse is used to mark
a contrast not expressed but implied, as here it might refer to
the Carpetani, whose impatiencesH. had not noticed.

c. xxrv. ξ, 1. Iliberri. The modern Elne, so called from
Helena, the mother of Constantine. It is here indeelfflable,
though the form Iliberrim is used below, as if from Ihberris,
and other Spanish towns have like ending, as Iliturgis, Cissis,
Bacasis. Strabo speaks of river and town both Ἰλίβιρρις.
There was also a town of the same name in the South of
ἓρέὼ, near the site of Granada, whence probably the Sierra

³ lvira.

ξ 2. Ruscinonem. La tour de Roussillon.

ς 3. misit, colloqui. The oratio obl. often follows directly
011 mittere oratores, literas, Sec. Cf. vm. 19. 10, literis Romam
missis, in officio Fzmclaiws esse. Fabri.
