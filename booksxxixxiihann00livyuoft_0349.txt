NOTE'S. XXII. c. xxxw. §9—0. xxxv. §4- 281

§ 9. ut 111 patrum pot. As the interrex was named by the
patres, and he conducted the electione, they would have more
influence over them than if a magistrate elected by the people

presided.

510. expugnatum, ‘carried their point by force,’ as if it
were a violence done to the constitution.

P, 115, § 11. certe, ‘an undoubted right,’ gained by the
Liciniau laws ac. 367, consulum utique alter explebe crearetur,

Liv. VI. 35. 3.

uberum hab. ‘would use it freely,’ as Ovid, Fast. 1. 52,
Verbaque honoratus libera praetor habet, also 60. 9, quum noctem
liberam habuisset.

one, and quitted the city in disgust. W. remarks that a special
bill must have been passed to enable AEmilius Paulus to be
re-elected within 10 years as was done afterwards, Liv. xxvn.

6. 7.

ambustus is the same metaphor as 40. 3, se populare incen-
dium priore consulatu semustum effugisse. Cf. Juv. vm. 92,
quam fulmine iusto Ι et Capito et Numitor ruerint damnante
senatu.

ς 4. comitiali dle. The comit. d. were probably at first

affere, as distinct from the dies nefasti, on which for various
religione reasons no business could be done. Afterwards the
faeti were restricted to a smaller number of days when judicia-l
