170 NOTES. XXI c x11. 54—0. xm. §3-

gich blunder, by which the tentare from tentus, tendere was
assimilated to the temptas from temnere, in which the p was
inserted for euphony between m and n.

Hispanum. Either generally, or in distinction to the
Saguntines who were said to be of foreign rece.

movebant. Fabri remarks on the frequent use of the
imperf. with postquam, in cases where the action is supposed
still to continue. Cf. 111. 60. 8, postquam jam multa dies erat,

mque movebatur quicquam.

cond1010nes.Harsh conditione were named as might be
expected from an implacable enemy) This spelling of con-
dicio is almost invariably found' 111 the best MSS. and inscrip-
tions; the derivation from condere must therefore be given up
in favour of that which connects it with dicio, judicare, δίκη,
and the root dila. On the use of ut, cf. 7. 7.

transfuga ex or. ‘ Turned deserter instead of advocate!

sub condic. The sub is very rarely used in this connexion,
as condicio is used absolutely 111 the abl. Heerwagen thinks
that it emphasizes the dependent condition of the Sagun-

tines.

Ρ, 14, §6. mterpretem. For the use of the word cf. 11.
33.14‚}1ui0 interpreti arbitroque concor-dice civium. Curtius

connects interpres with S. prat, and φραδ, φράσσω.
publice S. ‘Recognized by the State of Saguntum as,' dcc.

§8. senatus datus. ‘Audiense was given in the senate
to.' This sense suits most of the passages in which the
phrase is used in Livy, but in some it can only refer to a
special meeting convened for the purpose, as in xxvn 21. 1,
where the praetor calls the senate together to discuss the
elaims of an applicant for a triumph. So too of the corres-
ponding expressions, xxm. 7. 11, senatum extemplo postulat,
where the demand is for a special meeting.

c. xm. §L veni. The subj. venissem of the MSS. here
seems out of place in reference to the definite hoc iter, and
Madvig reads veni. sed, thinking that this was written veni
set, then changed to venisset, and afterwards as a mistake in
the person to venissem.

ξ 2. pro. ‘ In the name of,' ‘ out of regard for.'

ξ 3. loqui, quae loquor. A sort of repetition constantb
ocem-ring in Latin writers. Fabri compares Quintil. 1x. 3. 80,
accedit et ex illa fi9uwra 9ratia, qua nomina dimi mutatis casibus
repeti ⁴ non minus cederet quam cessit.'

vel ea fides sit. ‘ Evidence may be found in the fact that.’
