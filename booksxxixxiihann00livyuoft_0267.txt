§⁷- nlve oppleta. The climate was probably even moro
severe than at present, owing to the thick foreste which then
covered great part of Germany.

ξ 8. prospectus. A fanciful pictuse, which is hardly
borne out by facts. as no such view can be obtained near the
summit of the Mont Genevre, nor indeed of any other of the
pasees. The description of Polybius does not imply any such
actual view of the plains of Lombardy, for his word ἐνάργεια
may mean ¹ evidence ’ or ⁶ proof' addressed to the reason, and
not to the sight. Many unsuccessful attempts have been made
to find a likely scene for this speech.

ἓ 9. moema It. Cf. Polyb. 111. 54, ἀκροπόλεως φαίνονται

ostentat.

' sieut breviora. This generalization is not found in Polyb.,
and indicates increased knowledge of the Alps since the
conquest of Gaul.

g 12. neque sustinere se a lapsu. Cf. xxn. 2. β.

nec, qui paulum... The reading of the MSS. is here as-
flicti, which is harder. With it the passage would mean ‘ and
if they stumbled but a little, down they feu and could not
help slipping further ' (lit. ⁴ could not ch'ng to the place where
they were dashed to the grounds cf. Caes. B. G. VI. 27, neque si

keep their footing. Affliyere and affiyere are elsewhere con-
tused in the MSS.

succiderent is a more questionable change for occiderent. .
