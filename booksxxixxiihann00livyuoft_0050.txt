fondly recurred to the old models of archaic diction,
and the accomplished Emperor Hadrian, who set up
for a literary critic, avowed his preference of Caelius
Antipater to Sallust (Spartian. IIadr. 16). His wri-

Republic, for Brutus took the trouble to compress
them into shorter form, and Cicero asks Atticus to
send him the Epitome of which he had just heard
(Epitomem Bruti Ocelianorum, Cic. ad Διί. XIII. 8).
His history of the Punic war was singled out for
special mention (in proemio belli Punici, Cic. Or. 69),
and in this we are told that he followed Silenus very
closely (Cic. de divin. 1. 24). In the third decade
Livy mentions him more often than any other writer,
and in terms which show that his evidence ranked
very high, and should be weighed in any conflict of
authorities. There is reason to believe that he was
often used when not explicitly referred to. The dream
of Hannibal at Omma, as found in Livy XXJ. 22. 5,

served for us (de divin. Ι. 24), and which as we are
told was first drawn from Silenus. So too of the

xxn. 3), which Cicero (de div. 1. 35) quotes to like

quake which passed unnoticed by the combatants in
the same battle. There are a few words quoted from
