have. Madvig remarks, nullum prosaz orationis certum cx-
emplum novi ubi dativus ,qm-undu· accusativum reflat. He
thinkfs thatffgrhaps we ought to read equiti which is found in
an 1n error .

ξ 2. centenos. The distributive is used because there
were the same number both of horse and soot.

corpora euml-e. Frequent in Livy. Cf. cutem curare. In
English we do not particular-ize, but say ⁴ reiresh thomselves.'

§3- praetorium. The staff, or eouncil of war, consisting
of leyatt', tribuni, centuriones primi pili, and prcesecti, so called
from meeting in the general's tent. On the use of missum for
‘dismissed‚' cf. the origin of the term mass, from the last
words of the service missa est.

dRobora virorum. Abstr. for concrete. Cf. 34. 5, robore
pe itum.

turmis. Troops of 30 horsemen, ten of which formed the
cavalry of each legion. Varro, Ling. Lat. v. 91, explains the
word turma terima (c in u abiit) quod ter <leni equites ex tribus
tribubus fiebant.

manipulis. Each legion had 30 maniples of 100 infantry
each. After-warde each manipulus was divided into two cen-
eurioe. They were called from the bundle of> hay, which in
rude days was the sign oi each, perticas manipulis foeni varie
somnatc's in summo junctas. Aur. Vict. Orig. R. 22. 4.

ς 4. mille eq. mille ped. Livy is fond of this sort of
jssffsztriviiffiriicithom a conjunction. Cf. 1. 25. 12, fessum vulnere

Magone. The MSS. have Magoni and no cum, which, 01·
some equivalent, seems required.

iniecto cert. Cf. xxxrv. 4. 15, iniicere certamen uxoribus.

ἓ 6. The MSS. have destinatum ..... consilio, ‘to the
struggle which he had long been planning,' possibly under-
standing certamen 01· id quod, but the constr. is harsh, and is
therefore corrected by Madvig. Sempronius neglected in this
battle the most elementary rules of war. He fought with a
river in his rear, where defeat was ruin. He exposed his army
to attaek while crossing in full view oi the enemy, and. he ,
ignored the most obvious precautions as to food and cold. On
the other hand, Hannibal's eonfidcnce in his own genius is
shown in letting the Roman army cross the river and form
upon the bank without taking advantage of their confusion.
His policy was not to defeat merely, but to annihilato the
enemy, and to prove to the world that he was more than a
match for the Romans on a fair field.
