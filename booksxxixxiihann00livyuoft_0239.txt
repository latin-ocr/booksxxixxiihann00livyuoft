§4- sardos. These hostilities took place just after the
lst, and before the 2nd Punic war. Sardinia, which Rome
had wrested from Carthago at the end of the lst Punic war,
rebelled shortly afterwards and made common cause with the
Corsicans, whose indignation had been roused by the refusal of
the Roman government to recognize the treaty of peace just
concluded without its sanction, nor would they accept the person
of M. Claudius Glicia, the author of the obnoxious treaty. The
unhealthy climate stayed awhile the progress of the Roman
arms, but both islands were finally subdued by Sp. Carvilius,
ao. 234.

The Illyrians, Β. c. 230, under the queen-regent Teuta pro-
voked hostilities by their piracies on Italian traders and mur-
der of the R. envoys, but they were speedily defeated, as were
also the Histriam who followed their example.

tumultuatum. These passive forms of neuter verbs are
especially frequent in historical writers, e. g. discursum, pro-
cursum, consensum, desperatum, introitum, transcensum. The
term is iustified by the old phrase often used 01 Gallicus tumul-
tus which Cicero thus explains, tumultum maj0res nostri Itali-
cum quod erat domesticus tumultus, Gallicum quod erat Italiae
finitimus, proeterea nullum tumultum nominabant. Phil. 8. 1.
But the alarm at Rome as described by Polybius, 11. 24, and
the care with which the muster-rolls of the Italian contingente
were reviewed, show how real the danger was then thought
to be, though the great victory at Telamon soon put an end
to it. As to form of the sentence cf. 11. 26. 1, tumultus fuit
verius quam bellum.

§ 5. trium et vig. includes the whole period between the
two Punic ware, 241—218 13.c., though the conquest of Spain
was not begun so early.
