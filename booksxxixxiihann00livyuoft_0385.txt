ROMAN RELIGION. 317

of Saored Law. It knew the time-honoured methods by which
each Power Divine must be approached; it alone had necess
to the ancient formularies of prayer, and all the nice rules οἱ
sacrificial usage. None but the Pontias could be trusted
to draw up the Calendar from year to year, and deter-
mine all the questions of casuistry which were suggested
by its fasts and feasts. For the worship oi the Romans was
tull of Pharisaic scruples. The slightest deviation from old
usage might vitiate a long round of ceremonial forms, and the
whole service must begin afresh, or the jealous Power might
withhold its favour. In Cato's work on Agriculture we find
the author not content with rules of close economy and
skilful farming; he must also add a sort of Liturgy or
Common Prayer-Book for the use of the labourers upon the
farm, and the rubrics, extracted as they doubtless were from
the text-books of the Pontiffs, help to show us how labori-
ously painstaking was the temper of Roman worship. But
with all its scrupulous care it could not but go wrong at
times, the Sacred College therefore was called on to provide
a remedial machinery to soothe the anger of the offended

' Powers. Was it a case merely of some ceremonial neglect?

the mistake observed might be corrected, the faulty service
be repeated (instaurare), the compensation made for the
offence, and the expiation (piaculum) was held to be com-
pleted. This was indeed no absolution for a guilty conscience,
for the forms prescribed dealt only with the outer act, and
gave no promises of peace to minds diseased.

Often however no human eye had noted what was wrong,
and it was left then for the gods to give their warnings
through unearthly signs (prodiyia). If the signs were given on
private ground it rested with the owner of the land to set his
house in order; but is the place was public ground, then the
portent was a matter for the State (publicum prodigium), who
must accept the charge (suscipere), and take the needful steps
through her officials (procurare prod.) to satisfy the gods and
set the public mind at rest. Here again was a wide field
opened for the action of the Pontiffs. Others might shudder
only in their ignorant panio, but they must learn to recognize
the voice which spoke in portents, must turn over their old
books and profit by the inductione of the past, must be ready,
if they only could, to provide the state with their Authorized
Version of God's Word to man. For this purpose, after due
scrutiny of evidence, and rejection of the ill-attested (quia sin-
9uli auctores erant Livy v. 15. 1), the prodigies were chronicled
with care from year to year in the priestly records, from which
Livy drew so largely for his history. To isolate them from
each other might mislead the student, rather they must be
regarded as the scattered phrases of the message sent from
