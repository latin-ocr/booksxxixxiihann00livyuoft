190 NOTE'S. XXI. c. xxvm. ἓξ 3-10.

, § 3. adverso...repeats the ex adverso of ἓ 2, which is here
balanced by ab ter-90.

§ 4. utroque vim facere. ‘ To offer battle on both sides.’

§5. variat. Madvig's correction of variata 01 MSS„ as
precipitat for precipitatus, 25. 9. Cf. fama variat, xxvn. 27.
13. ‘ Some say that the elephante were crowded together on
the bank, and that the most spirited os them being provoked
by its driver, followed him as he retreated into the water (and
at last took to swimming) and drew the whole herd atterit,
and that as each grew frightened at the depth and lost its foot-
hold, the force of the current swept it to the opposite bank.'
The construction and the thought seem equally confused,
there is no MSS. authority for the inde inserted before nantem
by W„ yet without it nantem is very harsh, and is therefore
considered as a gloss by Madvig and Ruperti, the abl. also
seems out of place for the clause which states the final result.
Why the current should carry them across and not down the
stream is unexplained.

P. 30, timentem altitudinem. As to the belief that ele-
phants could not swim, cf. Plin. Nat. Hist. Vin. 10. 28, qaudam
amnibus (elephanti) maxime et circa fluvios vayantur, quum
alioquin nare propter maynitudinem corporis non possint.

ξ 6. ad fldem pronius, ‘ more credible.’
5 7. secunda aqua, ⁸ down the stream?

ἓ 8. The reading of the MSS. ut cum before ‘elephanti' is
hopeless: Madvig regards it as a corruption which grew out of
est tum. Others less probably read et for ut and expungo ubi,
Usener ⁵suggests tuto jam. ⁴ The elephants were driven,
females in frent, along the stationary raft as if it were a high-
way, and when they crossed into the smaller raft which was
moored to it, the hawsers with which this was temporarily
fastened were suddenly untied, and it was towed to the opposite
bank by a number of light craft) A like expedient is said to
have been tried at Messana in the lst Punic war.

ἓ 9. actuariis so called from their speed—thus the ‘Actu-
ary' was the quick writer.

ις 10. donec...agerentur. This use of the subjunctive for
a srmple fact occurs chiefly in later writers as Tac. Hist. Π. 35,
puyvzatum...donec praelium nox alrimeret. But it may possibly
be here explained as giving the reason of the ‘nihil trepidabant.

ceteris, ‘all its surroundingsst Polyb. says that there were
several such rafts, but Livy probably does not imply this.
