8.

recentis anim. A common form in Livy. Cf. 111. 3 8
praeserocis animi, xxn. 29. 8, infimi inqeuit'.

§3. inter Trebiam. These were most likely to the east
of the Trebia, for on the west lay the Ligures, and the Gallio
allies of H„ as the Insubres. ἓ 9 implies that some at least
were to the west, ii the R. were on the east of the T.

per ambiguum, i.e. maintaining friendly attitude to both
sides, and so doubtless intending to gain the good will of the
conqueror.

P, 57, ὅ 4. modo ne quid. ‘ Provided only that they did
not) Cf. tantum ne, 19. 5.

ς 6. ad ld dubios. ‘ Up to that time undecided.'

ab auct. To be taken with declinant. ‘Tm-n from the
:ugfigzsito'f the outrage to those who they hoped would

ἓ ¹7. infida...perfldia. The Romans used these epithets
{gagzfflgeof any taces who made a bold stand for their in-

utanav. ’Π other memories of the past could be for-
gotten.' Cf. 11. 38. 2, ut omnia obliviscamini alia, hanc con-
tumeliam quo tandem animo fertis.

ᾗ 8. ⁸ S. urged that the best ties to strengthen the loyalty
of their allies (dat. of the aim of the action) would be found

of desemos foran abstract substantive is a bold construction,
like oppositum in ἓ 1.

5 9. 0011. cunctante is Madvig’s correction for the reading
cum colleqam cunctantem, with no verb to complete it. Corssen
derives collega, not from legere, but from the same root as
lex, legatus, liqare, privileyium, in the sense of ‘bound to-
gether with‚' like conj‘ctyes.

Cf §52st8 3541 Ιέοο. osten used by Livy like Greek πρὸς τούτοις.

inopinato. Madvig's correction for inopinatos, which is
not used for inopinantes.

ς 11. The MSS. gave sequentesque cunque, which was
probably corrected by Gronovius to the present text„ The
words caedes penes in italice are a suggestion of Madvig to com-
plete what would be else a hopeless passage. W. has done
well to withdraw his earlier conjecture of Romano, under·
standing samci vict. with hostium.
