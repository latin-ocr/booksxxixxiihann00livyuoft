mactasset. Connected by Curtius, 293, with macellum,
μαχαιρα, μαχη. Cf. Lucr. v, 1339, boves Lucae ferro male
mactoe, and the fragment of Naevius restored by Miffler, Festus
p. 397, nullum peius macic hominem quamde mare soevum.

The MSS. have et before secundum pree. Madvig rejects
this on the ground that the omission of est after precatus
would be indefensible, as in the reading praecipitatus, 25. 8.

ξ9. velut diis auct. ‘As if each were assured that the
gods sanctioned his hopes.’ The quisque is not merely used
distributively with the collective ra ti, but is made an integral
part of the abl. abs. in which it is introduced as a subject.
Livy does this elsewhere with quisque as xxm. 24. 4, relictis
suis quisque stationibus in...locum concurrerunt, and with ipse
as 1v. 44. 10, causa ipse pro se dicta damnatur, xxxvnI. 47. 7,
causam apud vos accusantibus meis ipse legatis dico, and with
plerique, as xxxm. 9. 11, deinde omissis plerique armis
capessunt fuyam. He does the like in constructions with a
gerund as xxv. 23. 11, (estimando ipse secum. 11. 38. 6, insti-
9ando suos quisque populos effecere. rx. 29. 8, yerendo solus
censuram obtinuit. XLII. 53. 3, ad pecuniam pro facultatibus
quaeque suis pollicendum. On this peculiarity of Livy‘s style
see Madvig Kleine Philol. Schr. p. 367.

P, 50, c. nm. ξ 1. territos p. The portents, as seen of
old, commonly reflected the prevailing temper whether san-
guine or foreboding. Cf. what Bagehot says of such forms of
superstition as a source of national weakness. “In historica]
times, as we know, the panic terror at eclipses has been the
ruin of the armies which have felt it 3 or has made them delay
to do something necessary, or rush to do something destruc-
tive ...... A religion full of omens is a military missortune.”

ξ 3. procuratis. The technical term for the religious
ceremonies adopted to propitiate the powers whose displeasure
had been shown by natural signs.

obvius fit. Polyb. who gives the clearest account of these
operations describes Scipio as crossing first over the Po
(probably near Placentia), and then across the 'fficinuS (pro-
bably near Pavia) over the bridge specially built for him, 111.
