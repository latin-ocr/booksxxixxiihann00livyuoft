part only of the Roman unity, because exclusive of the
patricians. These concilia plebis could only be convened by
a tribune, or aedile, and the auspices were not taken before
they met, as in the case of the comitia. The resolutions passed
in them, called plebiscita, were long regarded as informal de-
clarations of the will of a single order of the state, and as
such were never sanctioned by the patrum auctoritas, though
the Hortensian law of n.c. 288 gave them binding force, and
thus raised them to the level of the loyes passed in the comitia.

§ 19. ipsum inst. ‘ Who sold his own goods retail! The
Romans markedly distinguished between the capitalist who
speculated wholesale and the retail chandler, who was usually
slave-born (servilia ministeria), or a foreigner. Cf. Cic. de
Off. 1. 42, illiberales et sordidi quastus mercenariorum, quorum
' operoe non artes emuntur: est enim illa merces auctoramentum

servitutis. Sordidi etiam putandi qui mercantur a mercato-
ribus quod statim vendant. Opificesque omnes sordida arte
versantur. Plautus reflects the old Roman contempt for retail
trade in the lines, Trinummus 1. 11. 178: nihil est profecto
stultius, neque stolidius Ι neque mendaciloquius, neque argutum

vici. Much of this feeling was probably due to the military
bias given to the Roman mind in early days, (cf. the charge
against the government of the Tarquins opifices ac lapicidas
pro bellatoribus factos, Liv. 1. 59. 11,) which threw the handi-
crafts and retail trades into the hands of aliens, and the slave-
born, who could not serve in the armies, but in later days
the stlilgma of slavery degraded all industria] 1abour, except in
agric ture.

make sense, the second is justified by the frequent usage of
Livy, as 1. 34. 5, cum divitiae jam animos facerent. The phrase
pecunia ex eo yenere q. is abrupt from the want of an article
or participle as in Greek.
