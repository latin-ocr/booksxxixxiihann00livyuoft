aversa a Vulturno, 43. 10, i.e. on the right bank, with its chief
outlets faeing the enemy and the north.

§8- media pugna. t. Equivalent to the media acies
tuenda of 111. 70. 2.

c. xnvl. ἓ 1. ut quosque... Polyb. says that he crossed in
two places; the passage means that the various bodies took

up their places in line where they crossed.

ς 3. utraque eomua.. Referring only to the iniantry, not
to the whole line of battle.

18 ξ44. et...0eterum... ‘partly,’...‘but especially! So ΧΗ,

ξ 5. dispares ac diss. ‘ Differing in use and shape.‘

P, 128, ξ· 9. ventus.. Cf. 43. 11. As W. remarks, Livy and
Polyb. ignore the story told by Zonaras (after Dion Cassius)
that Hannibal had the ground behind ploughed up to increase
the (lust. Frontinus tells the like of Marius. Strateg. 11. in-
commodum aliud subjecit, ita ordinata suorum acie, ut adverso
sole et vento et pulvere barbarorum occuparetur acies. Appian
Bell. Hann. 17 reckons up four devices of H. which helped
to gain the victory, the seem-ing the wind at his back, the
treachery of the deserters, simulated ssight, and ambuscades.

e. nvn. ξ 2. nuno relicto spatio. As the Romans were
much weaker in cavalry, it is probable that the arrangements
on the battle-field had this specially in view.

ἓ 3. nitentes has no regular construction, as the vir which
is in apposition with it takes a sing. detrahebat. Fabri com-
pares xxv. 19. 6, οοιιεαῑεε...ἀίυενε·ἱ, Fulvius in aarum Cumanum,
Claudius in Lucanos abit.

§4. par, dum. This reading is due to a very acute
suggestion of Madvig‚.in place of the animis parum constabant
ἓίιᾶζιῖὶξὲἰὺίῃῖὲίὲὃ. which like the pares of other MSS. gives

constabant„ ‘ Were unbroken.'
§5. diu. Polyb. says ἐπὶ βραχύ.

acle densa.. As above explained, the Roman ranke were
much deeper than usual. Polyb. 111. 113.

P. 129, a cetera prominentem. Polyb. explains this
much more clearly before his description of the battle, when
he says that Hannibal drew up some of the Celts ancl Iberians

19—9.
