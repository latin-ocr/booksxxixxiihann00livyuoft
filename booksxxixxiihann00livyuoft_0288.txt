moreover the ut ne are found close together. It seems better to

soen navales. In early days the Roman fieet was of little
importance, and service in the navy ranked far lower than
in the army. The ships were partly manned from the allies,
and the coast towns were especially required to fumish their
contingente of marines and rowers. Hence the term socii
navales, though Romans of narrow means and libertini were
also called upon to serve. This lower status lasted on even
under the empire, as may be proved from the official careers
indicated in the Inscriptions.

The Carthaginians had been much the more skilful in the lst
war, and the great victories of Rome were mainly gained by
devices which paralysed the pilot’s skill, and reduced matters
to a trial of strength, as by the machine of Duilius, which
locked the vessels together and enabled the Romans to board
the enemy’s ships.

§3. affatim=ad satim, ‘to wem-mess) or ‘satiety.' Usque
