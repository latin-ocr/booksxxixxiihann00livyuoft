278 NOTES. XXII. c. xxxm. §g 1-7

speaker; but it is rare to find the two tenses in such close
connexion.

c. xxxm. ἓ 1. speculator. The commercial relations of
the Uarthaginians must have made it easy for them to procuro
intelligence through the trading classes, who in Rome, as in
many Greek citios, were often aliens and slave-born.

fefellerat, absolutely as spe fallendi xxx. 57. 3.

ξ 2. coniurassent. This has puzzled the commentators
who understood it of some plot to tamper with the soldiers,
though their loyalty was at this time beyond suspicion. The
verb is used however of the military oath oi obedienee, cf. 38. 3
and Caesar, B. G. vn. l, and probably the slaves had tried to
enrol themselves in the legions as in the case reported by Pliny
to Trajan, Ep. 29, repertos inter tirones duos servos.

aeris gr. Cf. note on 10. 7.

§ 3. Demetrius (αἶνὴρ θράσος μὲν καὶ τόλμαν κεκτημένος, ἅλό·
’γιστον δὲ ταύτην καὶ τελέως αἶ’κριτον ΡΟΙ. 111. 19) had been re-
warded by Rome for his surrender of Corcyra by being made
governor in Illyria, but had risen in revolt again, and fied to
Philip when his army was routed, and Pharos taken.

P, 113, ἓ 5. Pineum. Teuta the queen dowager of the
Illyric Ardiaei had provoked Rome by her piracies and outrages
on Roman envoys. Defeated in the ensuing war she resigned
the government to Demetrius Pharos who ruled in the name of
her son Pineus over such territory as was left him by treaty.
After the revolt of Demetrius, the Romans spared the youthiul
Pineus, on condition of the payment of subsidies, which were
now overdue.

dies exierat. Cf. IV. 30. 18, indutiarum dies exierat.

diem proferri, ‘the term extended.’ The common reading is
proferre as si diem proferimus xxv. 38. 20, but the active voice
would be used more naturally of the creditor than of the debtor.

ἕ 6. in cervicibus. A metaphor taken from the yoke upon
the oxen. Cf. XLII. 50. 5, cervicibus proepotentem finitimum
reyem zmpovzere.

ἓ 7. aed. concordiae. This Chapel which stood beside that
of Juno Moneta on the Arx was distinct from the larger temple
of Concord, which stood on the slope of the hill towards the
Forum, and was founded by Camillus 13.c. 267, when the oon-
sulship was thrown open to the plebs.
