304 NOTES. XXII. c. Lx. §g 5—26.

Ρ, 144, ἓ 5. Τ. Manlius Torquatus. Descended from an
ancestor of like praenomen and nomen, whose title of Torquatus
is explained by Livy, vn. 10, as derived from the collar (torques)
of the Gaul whom he slew.

§11. Si, ut...si‚ ut. In both cases Madvig has corrected
the sicut of the MSS. which gives an awkward turn to the
sentence. He notes a similar mistake in the MSS. in vn. 13. 8
and xxnv. 2. 7, as also Tae. Hist. 1. 83, sicubi for si ubi.

P. Decius, 3-0. 340 near Saticula. Cf. vu. 34.

P. 145. calpurnius Flamma. in B.c. 258 near Camarina.

§15. deminuti...capite. The caput eomprised the sum
of the rights implied in persona} freedom, civil and family
status, and change in any of these respects might bring a
deminutio capitis with it. The forfeiture of freedom was of
course the worst or dem. maxima. In the case of those who
had given themselves up with arms in their hands it could not
be recovered easily by the forms of postliminium.

abalienato. Madvig‘s correction for abalienati of the MSS.
Livy uses the word elsewhere either absolutely or with a pre-
position. It would seem natural to say abalienari ab aliqua
re, in the sense of being estranged from a place οι· pursuit,
but not from a right (jure).

ἓ 17, conati sunt, m elliptioally put for ‘ and might have
succeeded if,' dcc.

P, 146, ξ 20. nam ‘ fortes ’ elliptically implies the reason
Ιζὶνιῖθέΐῖτίιίίᾶἒὲἰῖῑῑεεᾳαε was said instead of the usual combination

321. favisse. The MSS. read fuisse ut, which is evi-
dently corrupt. W. corrects it to fuisse usui whichsounds fll
and is somewhat weak, while Madvig’s suggestion is spirited
and balances invidere in the next line.

ξ 24. ante secundam h„ i. e. after sunrise.

ξ 25. Haec vobis. ‘ This, mark you‚' dac. Cf. Hor. Epist.
1. 3. 15, Quid mihi Celsus agit? It is called by grammar-iaus
the dativus ethicus.

ἓ 26. Et vos, Most MSS. have quos, which probably
grew out of the abbreviation for et and uos.

et is inserted by Madvig to avoid an awkward asyndeton
which sounds iu after cunct. ac manetis.
