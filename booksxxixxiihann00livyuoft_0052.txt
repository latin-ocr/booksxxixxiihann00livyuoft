xlii INTROD UCTION. II.

Livy’s tastes ,· the critical standard of the age did not
require such labour at his hands 3 the reading public
had not such severe historic canons, and much pre-
ferred a piece of fine writing to proof of antiquarian
research, and Livy naturally enough catered for the
literary appetites which he found around him. The
work which he had set himself to do seemed great
enough, and left him little leisure to sift and to com-
pareg the history of seven eenturies sti-etched out
before him, and he hurried on to rear his noble
monument to the memory of the Great Republic.

In this way may be probably explained both the
features of agreement and of difference between Poly-
bius and Livy, by supposing that some of the same
sources may be traced in both, from which the former
drew directly, while the latter used them as he found
them worked up already in the narrative of one who
was almost a contemporary of the Greek writer. 'Hie
theory itself is worthy of acceptance, even if we do
not lay much stress upon the evidence which seems to
point to Silenus as the common authority of both
alike, and to'Caelius as the compiler of the Roman

version of the story. It is chiefly in the earlier books .

that the probability of this is strongest 3 later in the
decade other influences seem to have come prominently
forward, among which may be mentioned memoirs
current in the Scipionic circle, native traditions or
chronicles of Africa, such as those consulted by King
J uba, and works of a later and diffuser style like those
of Valerius Antias,
