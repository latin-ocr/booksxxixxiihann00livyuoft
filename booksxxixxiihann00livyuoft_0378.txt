and over the Little St Bernard to the valley of Aosta. In
favour of this route the following reasons may be urged.

l. The local features of the pass agree at least as well as
any other with the general description of Polybius, and the
(letailed accounts of the measurements of space and time, with
the 15 days of march, that is, and the 1200 stadia of way. The
valley was a fertile one, and the native town which they at-
tacked and pillaged may well have enriched them with its
plunder. The λευκόπετρον of the narrative may be probably
identified with the ‘ Boche Blanche ’ on the Reclus. The pass
is steeper on the Italian side, and the dangers therefore of the
descont would have been naturally greater, and in the ravine
below ‘la Tuile' there is a place where the old snow might
long remain unmelted, and the road for some way is much
exposed to avalanches. Here therefore Hannibal might find
the track completely swept away, and be obliged to halt until
a new path was cut upon the mountain side. Though the
pass itself is comparatively low, the season was advanced, and
fresh snow had lately fallen. The climate was possibly more
severe in those days than at present, and the hardships seemed
more fearful to an army from the South.

2. The pass called afterwards the Graian Alp was one of
the best known and earliest used across the mountains. By it,
streams of invading Gauls had passed centuries before. Its
neighbourhood was by far the most fertile of them all, and as
such best suited to supply an army on the march.

3. Its outlet was nearest to the country of the Gauls who
had sent to invite the Punic forces. Their envoys would
naturally know it best, and be most likely to guide the in-
vaders on that course. Intractable as the Romans found at a
later date the tribe of the Salassi, who held the upper valley of
⁴ Aosta, there was no reason why they should obstruct the pas-
sage of the enemies of Rome, and the other tribes, Libui or
Lebecz', who were settled lower down, may well have followed
the policy of the powerful Insubres, and sympathized in their
alliance nith the strangers. Polybius therefore did not stay to
mention them, indeed from the island of the Allobroyes he
records no names until he makes Hannibal issue from the Alps
among the Insubres, the leading state of the Gallio confederacy
against Rome. He gives his reasons for this silence, in the
general ignorance that prevailed of the exact position of the
tribes and localities in question.

Livy wrote, however, at a later date, when the Alpine tribes
and names were far better known to the Italian public. His
information therefore is more definite in that respect, and
