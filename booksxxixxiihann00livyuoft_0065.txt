INTRODUOTION. JV. lv

XS was common, not only in compounds like

aspecto, but in others like saxeum, promamus, and
inscriptions prove this in spise of the protests of

the old grammarians, who regarded the 8 as needless.

Assimilation of the last letter of the preposition
to the first of the verb with which it is compounded
began early, but the inscriptions of the end of the
Republic have forms like adclamaro, adlectus, adq-ideo,
cmzleqa, inlustris, varied by more medem forms.
The grammarians favoured the general aseimssation, ,
and the process went forward steadily, though modi-
fied by personal caprice.
