lights upon the mountain-sides the Romans in the pass, think-
ing that the enemy was escaping along the higher ground, left
their station in pursuit, and the main body of H. passed
through unmolested. Livy‘s account is vague in the extreme.

P, 94, Qua minime... ‘They made for the top of the
mountain-ridges, thinking that their safest course lay in the
direction where the lights were flashing least.'

§6. in fugam. According to Polyb., after collision with

Fucinus, whose chief city, Corfinium, was chosen as the seat
of empire by the Italians in the Social War. Its country was
too rugged to offer much plunder to H.

P. 95, ἓ 7. Gereonium (castellum Apuliae inops, 39. 16)
was 25 miles irom Luceria (Pol. 111. 100), and selected by H.

for his winter quarters, 23. 9.

ἓὸ. sacrorum e. Plut. Fab. 178, τῶν ἱερέων καλούντων ἐπί
τινας θυσίας. So we read occasionally of special appointments
of a dictator for ceremonial purposes, clavi figendi causa,
